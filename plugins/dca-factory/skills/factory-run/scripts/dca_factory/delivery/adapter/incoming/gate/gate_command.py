"""Story gate — the deterministic part of a factory run: what decides.

Reads the backlog (markdown with front matter) and the stack profile, then checks what a stage may
not decide for itself. Exit code 0 means the stage may proceed. What only *shows* the pipeline —
status, help, usage, session logs, the checkout claim, the schedule — is `factory-cli.py` beside this
file; a flag that moved there is handed over, so an older caller still gets its answer.

    story-gate.py --story <id> --stage <plan|test|build|tidy|document|adopt> [options]
    story-gate.py --change [--staged] [--checks <c>]   the profile's checks outside a story; --staged
                                                       checks what the commit contains (the hook, CI)
    story-gate.py --parity <config>                    every implementation's reports prove every
                                                       mandatory scenario of a scenario contract
    story-gate.py --check-backlog [--story <id>]       the plan gate's backlog checks over every story
                                                       that is not done; exit 1 when one is refused
    story-gate.py --project                            the project description (product and technical)
                                                       alone; exit 3 while a part is missing, 1 when
                                                       one is incomplete
    story-gate.py --check-contract                     the profile's contract and model keys alone
    story-gate.py --record-base | --record-changes <stage>   the tree a story's diff is taken against,
                                                       and what a stage changed (with --story)

Options:
    --epics <dir>       where the epics and stories are (default: the profile's `epics:`, else product/epics)
    --runs <dir>        the run artefacts (default: the profile's `runs:`, else .dca-factory/runs)
    --root <dir>        the project's root (default: .)
    --profile <file>    stack profile (default: dca-factory.profile.yaml in the project root)
    --json              additionally print the result as one JSON object

Checks by stage:
    plan   epic completeness (intent, goal, metric, domain_contact), story well-formed and not
           left in draft, its bounded context present in the context map, the round limit not
           reached, and a note when the project instructions are too large for a tool to load
    test   epic + every acceptance criterion mapped to a test in <runs>/<story>/tests.md,
           the test exists in the sources, the test sources compile, every mapped test is red.
           Which selectors were red is recorded in <evidence>/<story>/.tests-red
    build  epic + mapping + every mapped test is green **and was recorded red by the test stage**,
           every test command the profile's `required:` names, run whole (the stories before this
           one still hold), plus every extra check the profile declares for this stage
           (architecture suite, formatter, …). Without the record the green run is skipped and named, never taken as
           evidence: a runner that matched no test at all exits 0 exactly like a passing one. Every file
           the plan's `## Files` says `new` is there, every one it says `removed` is gone (contract 22)
    tidy   the same as build: nothing the refactor touched may have changed what the code does
    document  every path, file and identifier the document stage claims actually exists, every
           row of its glossary table names where its definition came from, and every term the plan
           proposed has landed in a glossary
    change the profile's compile, test, architecture and format commands against the working tree
           (or, with --staged, the Git index — refused when the working tree differs from it). A test
           command passes only when its reports show executed cases. The profile's `required:` line
           makes checks mandatory: a required check that is not declared, not run or ran nothing fails
    test, build, tidy  a test file that existed before the story (recorded by the plan gate) still
           holds every line it had; a changed or removed one needs an answered decision of stage test
    every stage  the story's decision records in its folder (`<story>/decisions/`): a `## needs-human`
           section names one, an open one stops the story, an answered one is applied by the
           stage that asked and then stamped `## Applied` here

Where things are — one owner per place: `product/` is the people's (the description, the epics with
their stories, each story a folder with its decisions), `.agents/factory/` is the installed pipeline,
the profile at the root is the person's, and `.dca-factory/` is the run's protocol (hand-overs, marks,
the journal), disposable at any time: what is delivered stands in the story itself (`status:
delivered`, written by the gate alone), so deleting the run folder loses history, never state.

A command the profile does not declare is skipped and named, never failed.
