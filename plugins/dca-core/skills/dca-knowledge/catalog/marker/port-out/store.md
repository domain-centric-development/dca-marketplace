Marker interface for Stores — output ports that record or query operational data without an own
aggregate lifecycle.

**Repository vs. Store:**

- Use `y` for **Aggregate Roots** with identity and lifecycle (findById,
save, delete).
- Use `e` for **Value Objects, Events, or operational data** without aggregate
lifecycle (record, count, exists, lookup by key).

**Examples of Stores:**

- `LoginProtectionStore` — records login attempts; queries failure counts
- `AuditLogStore` — appends audit entries; queries by time range
- `EventStore` (Event Sourcing) — specialization for Domain Events

**Rules of thumb:**

- Lookup by key (`findById()`) is allowed on a Store; aggregate lifecycle requires a
Repository
- Need `record()` or `count()`? → `e` (object is recorded, not managed)
- In doubt: if the stored object is a `Value` or a record, it's almost always a Store.
