Outbound port for publishing integration events across bounded-context boundaries.

Use cases publish boundary-crossing facts through this port; the implementation (e.g. a
transactional-outbox adapter) decides how the event becomes durable and reaches external
consumers. This keeps the application layer free of delivery concerns.

Distinct from `r`: that port publishes in-context `DomainEvent`s after persistence; this one publishes the versioned, serializable `t` contract to other contexts or systems.

Note the two-level port distinction of the outbox subsystem: this interface is an
**application output port** (used by use cases) and therefore carries the `t`
marker. The outbox *store* behind it is an internal port of the outbox adapter subsystem —
no use case depends on it, so it deliberately carries no marker.
