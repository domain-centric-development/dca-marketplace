Marker interface for Value Objects.

A Value Object describes a characteristic - an amount of money, an address, a quantity - and
has no identity: two values with the same attributes are the same value. It is immutable; a
change produces a new instance. Because it has no life cycle of its own, it is never loaded or
saved on its own - it travels inside the Entity or Aggregate Root that holds it.

**Characteristics:**

- Immutable: all fields final, no setters; a record is the natural shape
- Equality by attributes, not by reference or identifier
- Self-validating: the constructor rejects values that make no sense in the domain
- Behaviour is side-effect free and returns new values (`money.add(other)`)
- Must not reference Aggregate Roots or Entities

**Example:**

```java
public record Money(BigDecimal amount, Currency currency) implements Value {
  public Money {
    Objects.requireNonNull(amount, "amount");
    Objects.requireNonNull(currency, "currency");
  }

  public Money add(Money other) {
    requireSameCurrency(other);
    return new Money(amount.add(other.amount), currency);
  }
}
```

Identifiers are Value Objects too, but carry their own marker: `d`.
