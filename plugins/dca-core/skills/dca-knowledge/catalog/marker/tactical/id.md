Marker interface for typed identifiers of Entities and Aggregate Roots.

An identifier is a Value Object whose only job is to name one Entity for its whole life.
Giving every Entity its own identifier type (`ContractId`, `ShipmentId`) instead of a
bare `UUID` or `String` lets the compiler reject one aggregate's id passed where
another's is expected, and lets a Repository's signature say which aggregate it manages.

**Characteristics:**

- Immutable, with attribute equality - a record is the natural shape
- Validates its own wrapped value (never null, well-formed)
- Carries no behaviour beyond identity; generation (`newId()`) may live on the type
- Lives in the domain layer of the context that owns the Entity; identifiers shared across
contexts belong in the shared kernel

**Example:**

```java
public record ProductId(UUID value) implements Id {
  public ProductId {
    Objects.requireNonNull(value, "value");
  }

  public static ProductId newId() {
    return new ProductId(UUID.randomUUID());
  }
}
```
