Interface for Domain Events.

Domain Events represent something that happened in the domain that domain experts care about.
They are internal to a bounded context and can evolve freely without versioning concerns.

**Characteristics:**

- Immutable (final classes or records)
- Named in the past tense (e.g., ContractSigned, ShipmentDispatched, PriceChanged)
- Include timestamp, unique ID, and event-specific data
- Carries no container stereotype and no listener annotation - it is data, not a bean
- Part of the Ubiquitous Language
- Internal to a bounded context — no versioning needed

**Use Cases:**

- Triggering side effects in other aggregates or contexts
- Enabling eventual consistency between bounded contexts
- Audit trail and event sourcing
- Decoupling bounded contexts

**Required Methods:**

- `eventId()` - Unique identifier for this event instance
- `occurredOn()` - When the event occurred

For events that cross bounded context boundaries, see `t` which adds
versioning for backward compatibility.

**Example:**

```java
public record ProductCreated(
    UUID eventId,
    ProductId productId,
    Instant occurredOn) implements DomainEvent {

  public static ProductCreated now(ProductId productId) {
    return new ProductCreated(UUID.randomUUID(), productId, Instant.now());
  }
}
```
