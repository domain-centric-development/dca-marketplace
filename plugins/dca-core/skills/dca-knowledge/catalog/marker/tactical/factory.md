Marker interface for Factories.

Factories encapsulate complex object creation logic, particularly for Aggregates and Entities.
They ensure invariants are maintained from the moment of creation and hide complex construction
details.

**When to Use:**

- Object construction is complex and involves multiple steps
- Creation requires knowledge not belonging to the object itself
- The constructor would violate the object's invariants
- Need to create different configurations of the same type

**Characteristics:**

- Stateless or with minimal state
- Return fully formed, valid objects
- Should NOT have Spring annotations (@Component, @Service)
- Part of the domain model

**Example:**

```java
public class ProductFactory implements Factory {
  public Product createProduct(ProductName name, SKU sku, Price price) {
    // Complex construction logic and validation
    return new Product(...);
  }
}
```

**Alternative:** For simple cases, static factory methods on the domain object itself
(e.g., `Product.of(...)`) are preferred over separate Factory classes.

Domain Object"
