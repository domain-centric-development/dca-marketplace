Marker interface for Aggregate Roots.

An aggregate root is the entry point to an aggregate - a cluster of domain objects that are
treated as a single unit. The aggregate root is responsible for maintaining invariants within the
aggregate and collecting domain events that occur during state changes.

**Domain Events:**

Aggregate roots collect domain events when state changes occur. These events are published
after the aggregate is persisted, enabling eventual consistency and loose coupling between
aggregates and bounded contexts.

**Usage Pattern:**

```java
// 1. Aggregate performs business operation and raises event
product.changePrice(newPrice);

// 2. Repository saves aggregate
productRepository.save(product);

// 3. Use case publishes and clears the events, still inside the transaction
eventPublisher.publishAndClearEvents(product);
```

Publishing and clearing is one step, `DomainEventPublisher.publishAndClearEvents`: the
publisher dispatches every collected event and clears the aggregate only once every listener
returned. Iterating `domainEvents()` and calling `publish` per event leaves the
clearing to the caller and is not the sanctioned form.
