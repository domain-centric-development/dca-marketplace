Marker interface for Entities.

An Entity is a domain object defined by its identity, not by its attributes: a line item stays
the same line item while its quantity changes, and two line items with equal attributes are still
two. Every Entity carries a typed identifier (`d`) that is stable for its whole life.

An Entity that is not itself an Aggregate Root lives inside exactly one aggregate. It is
created, changed and removed only through its root, is never loaded or saved on its own, and is
therefore never returned from a Repository. Its identity is unique within the aggregate, not
necessarily across the system.

**Characteristics:**

- Has an identifier field returned by `id()`
- Equality means identity: `sameIdentityAs(Entity)` compares identifiers only
- Changes state through behaviour methods named in the ubiquitous language, never setters
- Non-root Entities expose no public constructor - the Aggregate Root creates them
- Holds no reference to an Aggregate Root; it is reached from the root, not the other way

**Example:**

```java
public class LineItem implements Entity<LineItem, LineItemId> {
  private final LineItemId id;
  private Quantity quantity;

  LineItem(LineItemId id, ProductId product, Quantity quantity) { ... }  // package-private

  public LineItemId id() { return id; }

  public void increaseBy(Quantity amount) { this.quantity = quantity.plus(amount); }
}
```
