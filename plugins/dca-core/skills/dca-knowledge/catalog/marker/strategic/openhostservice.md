Marks a class as an Open Host Service in Domain-Driven Design.

An Open Host Service is the protocol a bounded context publishes for other bounded contexts to
consume — a relationship pattern, not a transport. In-process it is the context's `api`
package; over the network it is an incoming adapter (REST, gRPC, MCP, ...). Either way it
translates domain objects into a published language (DTOs), the way a REST controller translates
domain objects to JSON.

**Architectural rules:**

- Open Host Services live at the context boundary: in `api/` or anywhere under `adapter/incoming/` — never in the domain or application layer
- They must return DTOs, never domain objects
- Outgoing adapters of other contexts may only depend on a context's published `api/`
and `events/` packages
- Application-layer use cases never import another context's Open Host Service directly —
they go through their own output ports

**Usage:**

```java
@OpenHostService(
    context = "Product Catalog",
    description = "Provides product information for other contexts"
)
@Service
public class ProductCatalogService {
    // Returns DTOs, not domain objects
    public Optional<ProductInfo> getProductInfo(ProductId id) { ... }
}
```
