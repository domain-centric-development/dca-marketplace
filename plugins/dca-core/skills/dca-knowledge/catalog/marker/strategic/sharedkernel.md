Marks a package as the Shared Kernel in Domain-Driven Design.

A Shared Kernel is a small, carefully curated subset of the domain model that is shared
between bounded contexts. Changes to the Shared Kernel require coordination between all teams
that use it.

**Usage:** Place this annotation on a `package-info.java` file at the root of the
shared kernel package.

```java
@SharedKernel(description = "Common value objects and DDD markers")
package com.acme.shop.sharedkernel;

import dev.domaincentric.dca.buildingblocks.ddd.strategic.relationships.SharedKernel;
```

**What belongs in the Shared Kernel:**

- Universal value objects (Money, Currency)
- Cross-context identifiers (ProductId, UserId)
- DDD marker interfaces (Entity, AggregateRoot, Value)
- Common domain primitives

**What does NOT belong in the Shared Kernel:**

- Aggregates (each belongs to one context)
- Context-specific business logic
- Infrastructure concerns
