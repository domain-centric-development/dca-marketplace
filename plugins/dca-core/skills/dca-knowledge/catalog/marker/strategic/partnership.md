Declares a Partnership between two bounded contexts: both teams coordinate the evolution of a
shared contract and succeed or fail together on it.

A partnership is a *governance* relationship, not a technical one. It grants no
dependency permission — every actual directed dependency still requires its own `m`
declaration on the downstream side. A typical example is a consumer-defined trigger interface:
the consumer owns the contract, the producer implements it, and both must evolve it together.

**Usage:** Place on the bounded context's `package-info.java`. Partnerships are
symmetric — the declaration must exist on *both* contexts:

```java
@Partnership(context = "checkout", rationale = "CartCompletionTrigger contract evolves jointly")
package com.acme.shop.cart;
```

**Architectural rules** (enforced by `ContextMapArchUnitTest`):

- Only packages annotated with `t` may
declare `@Partnership`
- The target context must exist and must not be the declaring context itself
- The declaration must be mirrored by the target context (symmetry)
