Marks a package as a Bounded Context in Domain-Driven Design.

A Bounded Context is an explicit boundary within which a domain model exists. Each Bounded
Context has its own Ubiquitous Language and should be isolated from other contexts.

**Usage:** Place this annotation on a `package-info.java` file at the root of a
bounded context package.

```java
@BoundedContext(name = "Product Catalog", description = "Product management and catalog")
package com.acme.shop.product;

import dev.domaincentric.dca.buildingblocks.ddd.strategic.BoundedContext;
```

**Architectural Rules:**

- Bounded contexts must not directly depend on each other (except via Shared Kernel or
events)
- Each bounded context has its own domain, application, and adapter layers
- Cross-context communication should use domain events or Anti-Corruption Layers
