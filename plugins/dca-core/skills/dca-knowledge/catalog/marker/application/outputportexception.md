Base class of every failure an output port's contract declares.

**Who declares, raises and catches it.** The output port declares it in its contract, in
the application layer beside the port; the outgoing adapter that implements the port raises it,
because the contract asks for it; the use case that calls the port catches it and decides the
answer - a case of its result where the caller can answer it, or its own `UseCaseException`. The adapter raises it, but does not own it: an adapter never invents a failure
the application has not declared.

**For an expected failure the port's caller can answer** - a uniqueness only the store can
see, or a foreign system behind the port that refused or did not answer (a payment provider, a
mail provider: an external system on the context map). A failure of the system's own
infrastructure - its database, its broker - is no part of the contract and stays the platform's
own exception.

**Inside the transaction.** The use case may catch it inside its transaction and return a
refusal: a returned `Refusal` rolls the transaction back like the exception would have.

**Never caught as such.** A use case catches the named subtype the port declares, not this
base.
