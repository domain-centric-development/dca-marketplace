Explicit transaction boundary inside a use case — an application-layer execution abstraction,
**not** an output port.

An output port describes a capability the application needs from the outside world (store an
aggregate, look up a price, publish an event). A transaction is no such interaction: it defines
the execution semantics of several of them. The interface therefore lives beside the use cases
and does not extend `OutputPort`; the implementation is infrastructure (Spring: `TransactionTemplate`).

The default boundary is the use case itself (`@Transactional`): load, mutate, save,
publish — all inside one short transaction. That default breaks down as soon as the use case also
talks to the outside world (payment provider, remote catalog, mail gateway): a remote call inside
the transaction holds a database connection for the duration of the call, and under load the
connection pool runs dry; a rollback after a successful remote call cannot undo the remote effect
either.

`TransactionBoundary` lets the use case draw the boundary by hand — remote reads before,
the transactional core inside, remote effects after (preferably as a reaction to an integration
event):

```java
Article article = articleDataPort.getArticleData(productId);   // remote read, no transaction
return transactionBoundary.inTransaction(() -> {               // short transaction
  ShoppingCart cart = carts.findById(cartId).orElseThrow();
  cart.addItem(productId, quantity, article.price());
  carts.save(cart);
  events.publishAndClearEvents(cart);
  return AddItemToCartResult.from(cart);
});
```

Domain events published inside `inTransaction(Supplier)` see the same transaction as
the save; after-commit listeners fire when it commits.

**Nesting.** A call inside a running transaction joins it (Spring's `REQUIRED`
propagation) — there is one commit, at the outermost boundary. A failure in an inner block marks
the shared transaction rollback-only even when the outer block catches the exception: the
outermost `inTransaction` then rolls back and throws instead of committing half of the
work. Implementations must preserve this; an in-memory implementation emulates it with a
rollback-only flag.

**Rules of thumb:**

- No remote call inside a transaction — neither in an annotated use case nor inside `inTransaction`.
- One aggregate per transaction; cross-aggregate consistency is eventual.
- Use the annotation when the whole use case is local; use `TransactionBoundary` when
it is not.
