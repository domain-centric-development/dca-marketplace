Base class of every failure an input port's contract declares.

**Who declares, raises and catches it.** The input port declares it as part of what its
operation may answer; the use case behind the port raises it; the incoming adapter that drives
the port catches it and turns it into its protocol's answer. Its one concrete branch is `UseCaseException`: every failure a use case reports extends that, so this type stays the
classification in the hierarchy, not something a project subclasses directly.

**Never caught as such.** An incoming adapter that catches `InputPortException`
answers every outcome the same way; it catches the named subtypes, each with its own answer.
