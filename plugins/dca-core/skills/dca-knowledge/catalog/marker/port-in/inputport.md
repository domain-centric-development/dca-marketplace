Marker interface for Input Ports (Hexagonal Architecture).

Input ports are the entry points to the application layer. They define how the outside world
(driving/primary adapters) can interact with the application. In Hexagonal Architecture terms,
input ports sit on the "left side" of the hexagon.

**Driving Adapters that use Input Ports:**

- REST Controllers
- GraphQL Resolvers
- CLI Command Handlers
- Event Consumers (external events)
- Scheduled Tasks
- MCP Tool Providers

**Common Input Port Types:**

- `e` - Command/Query pattern with INPUT and OUTPUT types
- Event Handlers - Process incoming events from other systems

**Key Characteristics:**

- Technology-agnostic (no framework dependencies)
- Defined in terms of application/domain concepts
- Implemented by application layer classes (use cases)
- Called by adapters in the incoming adapter layer

**Example Hierarchy:**

```java
InputPort (marker)
  └── UseCase<INPUT, OUTPUT>
        └── CreateProductInputPort extends UseCase<CreateProductCommand, CreateProductResult>
```
