# The Domain Model should be framework independent and should not use 3rd party libraries when possible

## Selection

Classes in <module>.domain.. of every module root, plus the classes of the packages the configured marker vocabulary declares its domain-facing roles in — the tactical roles and the outgoing ports — when they are on the classpath under scan. With the default vocabulary those are the building-blocks packages ddd.tactical.. and hexagonal.port.out..; with a project's own markers they are the packages those markers live in.

## Check

Every dependency targets a class in one of those same packages or in an allowed third-party package: by default java.., lombok.., org.apache.commons.lang3.., org.apache.commons.collections4.. and org.jspecify.annotations... A logging facade is deliberately not among them - which logging, validation or utility library a domain model may see is a project decision, made with withThirdPartyPackagesAllowedInDomain(...). The vocabulary's own packages are on the list because they are derived from the roles, so pointing a role at another library's type does not make that library a reported dependency. The application-layer roles and the incoming ports are not on the list, nor are the strategic annotations, nor the shared kernel unless it is a module root with a domain layer of its own. A dependency on any other package is reported.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types below the root namespace whose namespace lies under <Module>.Domain of every module root; the building-blocks types themselves are not selected.

**Check.** Every dependency whose target has a namespace points into one of those same domain namespaces or below an allowed prefix: the layout's third-party allow-list (by default System only - a logging, validation or utility library is a project decision, added with WithThirdPartyNamespacesAllowedInDomain) and the namespaces the configured marker vocabulary declares its domain-facing roles in - the tactical roles and the outgoing ports, which for the default vocabulary are Ddd.Tactical and Hexagonal.Ports.Out. The vocabulary's own namespaces are on the list because they are derived from the roles, so pointing a role at another library's type does not make that library a reported dependency. A building-blocks entry in the allow-list is ignored here, so the strategic attributes, the application-layer roles and the input ports are not allowed in the domain. The shared kernel is not on the list either, unless it is a module root with a Domain layer of its own. A dependency on any other namespace is reported, each distinct pair once.

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allDomainPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
