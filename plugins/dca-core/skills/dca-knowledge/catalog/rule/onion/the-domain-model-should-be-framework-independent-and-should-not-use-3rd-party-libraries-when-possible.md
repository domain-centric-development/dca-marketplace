## Selection

Classes in <module>.domain.. of every module root, plus the classes of the building-blocks packages ddd.tactical.. and hexagonal.port.out.. when they are on the classpath under scan.

## Check

Every dependency targets a class in one of those same packages or in an allowed third-party package: by default java.., lombok.., org.apache.commons.lang3.., org.apache.commons.collections4.. and org.jspecify.annotations.., plus whatever the layout adds. The building-blocks strategic and port.in packages are not on the list, nor is the shared kernel unless it is a module root with a domain layer of its own. A dependency on any other package is reported.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types below the root namespace whose namespace lies under <Module>.Domain of every module root; the building-blocks types themselves are not selected.

**Check.** Every dependency whose target has a namespace points into one of those same domain namespaces or below an allowed prefix: the layout's third-party allow-list (by default System and Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions, plus whatever the layout adds) and, of the building blocks, only Ddd.Tactical and Hexagonal.Ports.Out - a building-blocks entry in the allow-list is ignored here, so the strategic annotations and the input ports are not allowed in the domain. A dependency on any other namespace is reported, each distinct pair once.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-ONI-002",
        "The Domain Model should be framework independent and should not use 3rd party libraries"
            + " when possible",
        "Domain should be framework-independent (Dependency Inversion Principle)",
        arch -> {
          // Every discovered context's domain plus the shared kernel's own domain package — the
          // inclusion is explicit here, where the former base.*.domain.. wildcard covered the
          // shared kernel only as a side effect of matching one segment.
          List<String> domainPackageList = new ArrayList<>(List.of(arch.allDomainPatterns()));
          domainPackageList.add(DcaLayout.BUILDING_BLOCKS_TACTICAL_PACKAGE);
          domainPackageList.add(DcaLayout.BUILDING_BLOCKS_PORT_OUT_PACKAGE);
          String[] domainPackages = domainPackageList.toArray(String[]::new);
          List<String> allowed = new ArrayList<>(layout.thirdPartyPackagesAllowedInDomain());
          allowed.addAll(List.of(domainPackages));
          return classes()
              .that()
              .resideInAnyPackage(domainPackages)
              .should()
              .onlyDependOnClassesThat()
              .resideInAnyPackage(allowed.toArray(String[]::new))
              .allowEmptyShould(true);
        })
    .selecting(
        "Classes in <module>.domain.. of every module root, plus the classes of the"
            + " building-blocks packages ddd.tactical.. and hexagonal.port.out.. when they are"
            + " on the classpath under scan.")
    .checking(
        "Every dependency targets a class in one of those same packages or in an allowed"
            + " third-party package: by default java.., lombok.., org.apache.commons.lang3..,"
            + " org.apache.commons.collections4.. and org.jspecify.annotations.., plus"
            + " whatever the layout adds. The building-blocks strategic and port.in packages"
            + " are not on the list, nor is the shared kernel unless it is a module root with a"
            + " domain layer of its own. A dependency on any other package is reported.")

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allDomainPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
