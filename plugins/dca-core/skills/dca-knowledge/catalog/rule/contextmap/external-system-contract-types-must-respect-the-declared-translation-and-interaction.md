## Selection

Every @ExternalUpstream declaration on the package-info of every package carrying @BoundedContext whose contractPackages() is not empty, reading translation() and interaction(). status() is not consulted. A declaration without contractPackages() (wire-level contract, no vendor SDK) is skipped - it only documents the relationship.

## Check

With ANTI_CORRUPTION_LAYER, no class below the declaring context's package outside the matching adapter - <context>.adapter.outgoing.. for OUTBOUND, <context>.adapter.incoming.. for INBOUND - depends on a class in any of the contract packages. With any other translation (CONFORMIST), no class in <context>.domain.. does. That the adapter actually translates the contract is not established.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Every [ExternalUpstream] declaration on the marker class of every namespace carrying [BoundedContext] whose ContractNamespaces is not empty, reading Translation and Interaction. Status is not consulted. A declaration without ContractNamespaces (wire-level contract, no vendor SDK) is skipped - it only documents the relationship.

**Check.** With AntiCorruptionLayer, no type below the declaring context's namespace outside the matching adapter - <context>.Adapter.Outgoing for Outbound, <context>.Adapter.Incoming for Inbound - depends on a type in any of the contract namespaces or below. With any other translation (Conformist), no type in <context>.Domain does. That the adapter actually translates the contract is not established.

          CollectedViolations violations = CollectedViolations.withoutHeader();
          // Without contractPackages (wire-level contract, no vendor SDK) there is nothing to
          // check — the declaration then only documents the relationship.

## Helpers

### `CollectedViolations.check`

```java
/** Evaluates every rule, then throws all their violations at once. */
  static void check(List<ArchRule> rules, JavaClasses classes) {
    CollectedViolations collected = withoutHeader();
    rules.forEach(rule -> collected.addAll(rule, classes));
    collected.throwIfAny();
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.withoutHeader`

```java
/** A collector whose report is the bare list of violations. */
  static CollectedViolations withoutHeader() {
    return new CollectedViolations("");
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.addAll`

```java
/**
   * Evaluates one ArchUnit rule and records each of its violation details, suffixed with the
   * explanation of what the rule was checking — the detail alone ({@code Class A depends on B})
   * does not say why that dependency is wrong.
   */
  void addAll(ArchRule rule, JavaClasses classes, String explanation) {
    for (String detail : rule.evaluate(classes).getFailureReport().getDetails()) {
      add(explanation.isEmpty() ? detail : detail + " - " + explanation);
    }
  }

/** Evaluates one ArchUnit rule and records its violation details as they are. */
  void addAll(ArchRule rule, JavaClasses classes) {
    addAll(rule, classes, "");
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.throwIfAny`

```java
/**
   * Throws the collected violations as one {@link DcaRuleViolation}; nothing when there are none.
   */
  void throwIfAny() {
    if (!violations.isEmpty()) {
      throw new DcaRuleViolation(header, violations);
    }
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.add`

```java
/** Records one violation. */
  void add(String violation) {
    violations.add(Objects.requireNonNull(violation, "violation"));
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.isEmpty`

```java
boolean isEmpty() {
  return violations.isEmpty();
}
```

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `boundedContextPackages()`, `classes()`, `contextName()`, `packageAnnotations()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
