# Anti-Corruption Layer: upstream contract types must stay inside the matching adapter

## Selection

Every @Upstream declaration with translation() ANTI_CORRUPTION_LAYER on the package-info of every package carrying @BoundedContext whose context() names an existing bounded context, reading via() and status(). Declarations towards an unknown context are skipped.

## Check

Placement, whatever the status: no class below the declaring context's package outside the matching adapter depends on a class in the target context's channel sub-package or below - the outgoing adapter (<context>.adapter.outgoing..) for the API channel, the incoming adapter (<context>.adapter.incoming..) for the EVENTS channel. Presence, only for status() IMPLEMENTED (as in DCA-MAP-007): each declared interaction needs a class in that adapter depending on both that upstream channel and its own domain/application; a PLANNED declaration without any such code passes. Multiple upstream translators may share the package. Structure establishes a translation site, not translation quality.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Every [Upstream] declaration with Translation AntiCorruptionLayer on the marker class of every namespace carrying [BoundedContext] whose Context names an existing bounded context, reading Via and Status. Declarations towards an unknown context are skipped.

**Check.** Placement, whatever the status: no type below the declaring context's namespace outside the matching adapter depends on a type in the target context's channel namespace or below - the outgoing adapter (<context>.Adapter.Outgoing) for the Api channel, the incoming adapter (<context>.Adapter.Incoming) for the Events channel. Presence, only for Status Implemented (as in DCA-MAP-007): each declared interaction needs a type in that adapter depending on both that upstream channel and its own Domain/Application; a Planned declaration without any such code passes. Multiple upstream translators may share the namespace. Structure establishes a translation site, not translation quality.

## Implementation

The verbatim ArchUnit expression is in the evidence slice [Overview](/evidence/rule/contextmap/dca-map-008/overview.md); every helper it calls has a slice of its own, listed under *Evidence slices* below.

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `boundedContextPackages()`, `classes()`, `contextName()`, `layout()`, `packageAnnotations()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
