title: Every allowed dependency of a module declaration must be backed by an actual code dependency
rule: "A context declares only the dependencies it uses. An allowed dependency no class uses is a door left open: the next dependency through it passes the module boundary without anyone deciding it."
constraint: Every allowed dependency of a module declaration must be backed by an actual code dependency.
selects: "Every package carrying @BoundedContext whose package-info carries a configured and loadable module declaration (a module system's per-package declaration, for example Spring Modulith's), and each entry of its allowedDependencies attribute, read as DCA-MAP-006 reads it. Entries that name an edge of a PLANNED @Upstream declaration, and entries whose module is neither a bounded context nor a module root of the scan, are skipped. Without a configured and loadable module declaration the rule selects nothing and passes."
checks: "For every entry, at least one class anywhere below the declaring context's package has a direct dependency on a class in the named module's package - for 'module :: interface' in its sub-package of that name, for 'module' or 'module :: *' anywhere in the module. A named interface declared on a package of another name is not resolved and is reported as unused. Which layer holds the dependency is not checked here."

# Every allowed dependency of a module declaration must be backed by an actual code dependency

**Experimental.** This rule is binding only in a project that opted in to experimental rules - the architecture test calls `withExperimental()` (.NET: `WithExperimental()`) on its rule selection, or `dca-archunit.properties` sets `dca.rules.experimental = true`; without that opt-in the rule does not run and is information only, never a finding and never a reason to change code.

## Selection

Every package carrying @BoundedContext whose package-info carries a configured and loadable module declaration (a module system's per-package declaration, for example Spring Modulith's), and each entry of its allowedDependencies attribute, read as DCA-MAP-006 reads it. Entries that name an edge of a PLANNED @Upstream declaration, and entries whose module is neither a bounded context nor a module root of the scan, are skipped. Without a configured and loadable module declaration the rule selects nothing and passes.

## Check

For every entry, at least one class anywhere below the declaring context's package has a direct dependency on a class in the named module's package - for 'module :: interface' in its sub-package of that name, for 'module' or 'module :: *' anywhere in the module. A named interface declared on a package of another name is not resolved and is reported as unused. Which layer holds the dependency is not checked here.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Every namespace carrying [BoundedContext], provided the layout configures at least one module declaration attribute (a module system's per-module declaration) that is in the loaded assemblies; reads, reflectively, the AllowedDependencies entries of every configured module declaration the marker class carries. Entries that name an edge of a Planned [Upstream] declaration, and entries whose module is neither a bounded context nor a module root of the scan, are skipped. Without a configured and loadable module declaration the rule selects nothing and passes - the default here, because .NET draws module boundaries with projects, no preset names an attribute, and the compiler drops a project reference no code uses, so the compiled assemblies carry no stale edge to compare.

**Check.** For every entry - 'module', 'module :: *' or 'module :: named-interface', whitespace around '::' normalized - at least one type below the context namespace has a direct dependency on a type in the named module's namespace (a bounded context by its name, any other module root by its last segment) or, for a named interface, in that segment below it, compared ignoring case. Dependencies within the context itself do not count. Whether an undeclared dependency exists is DCA-MAP-006's and the isolation rules' business, not this rule's.

## Implementation

The verbatim ArchUnit expression is in the evidence slice [Overview](/evidence/rule/contextmap/dca-map-014/overview.md); every helper it calls has a slice of its own, listed under *Evidence slices* below.

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `boundedContextPackages()`, `classes()`, `contextName()`, `layout()`, `moduleRoots()`, `packageAnnotation()`, `packageAnnotations()`, `sharedKernelPackage()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
