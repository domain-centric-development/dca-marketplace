# Implemented Upstream declarations must be backed by an actual code dependency

## Selection

Every @Upstream declaration with status() IMPLEMENTED on the package-info of every package carrying @BoundedContext whose context() names an existing bounded context, reading via(). PLANNED declarations and declarations towards an unknown context are skipped.

## Check

For every channel in via(), at least one class anywhere below the declaring context's package has a direct dependency on a class in the target context's channel sub-package (api or events per the layout) or below. Which layer holds the dependency is not checked here.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Every [Upstream] declaration with Status Implemented on the marker class of every namespace carrying [BoundedContext] whose Context names an existing bounded context, reading Via. Planned declarations and declarations towards an unknown context are skipped.

**Check.** For every channel in Via, at least one type anywhere below the declaring context's namespace has a direct dependency on a type in the target context's channel namespace (Api or Events per the layout) or below. Which layer holds the dependency is not checked here.

## Implementation

```java

        "A declared IMPLEMENTED edge without any real dependency is stale (or premature — then it"
            + " is PLANNED) and would otherwise pass forever alongside an equally stale module"

## Helpers

### `packagesByName`

```java
private static Map<String, String> packagesByName(DcaArchitecture arch) {
  Map<String, String> byName = new LinkedHashMap<>();
  arch.boundedContextPackages().forEach(p -> byName.put(arch.contextName(p), p));
  return byName;
}
```

### `channelName`

```java
private static String channelName(DcaArchitecture arch, Upstream.Consumes channel) {
  return arch.layout().channelSubpackage(channel);
}
```

### `inPackageTree`

```java
private static boolean inPackageTree(String packageName, String root) {
  return DcaArchitecture.inPackageTree(packageName, root);
}
```

### `CollectedViolations.check`

```java
/** Evaluates every rule, then throws all their violations at once. */
  static void check(List<ArchRule> rules, JavaClasses classes) {
    CollectedViolations collected = withoutHeader();
    rules.forEach(rule -> collected.addAll(rule, classes));
    collected.throwIfAny();
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.withoutHeader`

```java
/** A collector whose report is the bare list of violations. */
  static CollectedViolations withoutHeader() {
    return new CollectedViolations("");
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.require`

```java
/** Records the violation unless the condition holds. */
  void require(boolean condition, String violation) {
    if (!condition) {
      add(violation);
    }
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.throwIfAny`

```java
/**
   * Throws the collected violations as one {@link DcaRuleViolation}; nothing when there are none.
   */
  void throwIfAny() {
    if (!violations.isEmpty()) {
      throw new DcaRuleViolation(header, violations);
    }
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.addAll`

```java
/**
   * Evaluates one ArchUnit rule and records each of its violation details, suffixed with the
   * explanation of what the rule was checking — the detail alone ({@code Class A depends on B})
   * does not say why that dependency is wrong.
   */
  void addAll(ArchRule rule, JavaClasses classes, String explanation) {
    for (String detail : rule.evaluate(classes).getFailureReport().getDetails()) {
      add(explanation.isEmpty() ? detail : detail + " - " + explanation);
    }
  }

/** Evaluates one ArchUnit rule and records its violation details as they are. */
  void addAll(ArchRule rule, JavaClasses classes) {
    addAll(rule, classes, "");
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.add`

```java
/** Records one violation. */
  void add(String violation) {
    violations.add(Objects.requireNonNull(violation, "violation"));
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.isEmpty`

```java
boolean isEmpty() {
  return violations.isEmpty();
}
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `boundedContextPackages()`, `classes()`, `contextName()`, `layout()`, `packageAnnotations()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
