title: Feature and use case packages within a module's application layer must not have cyclic dependencies
rule: "The packages directly below a module's application package are its features (application.<feature>.<usecase>) or, in a flat layout, its use cases (application.<usecase>). A feature is an optional, domain-named group of related use cases; it may depend on another feature in one direction, but a cycle between two of them means the grouping does not carry its weight - the shared concept belongs in application.shared, in the domain, or in one of the two. application.shared is the context-wide port package and is not a slice. The rule does not infer bounded contexts or aggregate ownership from the packages it slices."
constraint: Feature and use case packages within a module's application layer must not have cyclic dependencies.
