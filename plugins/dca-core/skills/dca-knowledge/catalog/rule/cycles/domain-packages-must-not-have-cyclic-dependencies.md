## Selection

One slice per module root, holding the classes in <module>.domain.model.. of that module. A module root is the shortest package prefix whose next segment is a layer segment, so modules are found at any depth; classes outside every module or outside domain.model are ignored.

## Check

The slices form no dependency cycle - no two modules' domain models depend on each other, directly or via further modules' domain models. Cycles between classes inside one module's domain model do not count, and dependencies into other layers do not count. Fewer than two slices pass.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** One slice per module root, holding the types in <module>.Domain.Model of that module and below. A module root is the shortest namespace prefix whose next segment is a layer segment, so modules are found at any depth; types outside every module or outside Domain.Model are ignored.

**Check.** The slices form no dependency cycle - no two modules' domain models depend on each other, directly or via further modules' domain models. Cycles between types inside one module's domain model do not count, and dependencies into other layers do not count. Fewer than two slices pass.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-CYC-001",
        "Domain Packages must not have cyclic dependencies",
        "Domain model packages should have clear boundaries and no cycles (Acyclic Dependencies"
            + " Principle)",
        arch ->
            slices()
                .assignedFrom(
                    moduleLayerSlices(
                        arch, root -> root + "." + layout.domainSubpackage() + ".model"))
                .should()
                .beFreeOfCycles()
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "One slice per module root, holding the classes in <module>.domain.model.. of that"
            + " module. A module root is the shortest package prefix whose next segment is a"
            + " layer segment, so modules are found at any depth; classes outside every module"
            + " or outside domain.model are ignored.")
    .checking(
        "The slices form no dependency cycle - no two modules' domain models depend on each"
            + " other, directly or via further modules' domain models. Cycles between classes"
            + " inside one module's domain model do not count, and dependencies into other"
            + " layers do not count. Fewer than two slices pass.")
```

## Helpers

### `moduleLayerSlices`

```java
/**
   * One slice per module, holding that module's classes in the layer {@code layerOf} names.
   *
   * <p>Replaces {@code slices().matching(base + ".(*)." + layer + "..")}. A slice pattern needs a
   * capture group to derive the slice identity, and {@code (*)} is exactly one segment — so the
   * matching form only ever sliced modules that were direct children of the base package, and a
   * grouped or nested one was silently excluded from the cycle check. Assigning slices explicitly
   * uses {@link DcaArchitecture#moduleRootOf(String)} and therefore holds at any depth.
   */

      DcaArchitecture arch, UnaryOperator<String> layerOf) {
    return new SliceAssignment() {

      @Override
      public SliceIdentifier getIdentifierOf(JavaClass javaClass) {
        String root = arch.moduleRootOf(javaClass.getPackageName());
        if (root == null) {
          return SliceIdentifier.ignore();
        }
        String layer = layerOf.apply(root);
        String pkg = javaClass.getPackageName();
        return pkg.equals(layer) || pkg.startsWith(layer + ".")
            ? SliceIdentifier.of(root)
            : SliceIdentifier.ignore();
      }

      @Override
      public String getDescription() {
        return "modules";
      }
    };
  }

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `moduleRootOf()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
