# Specifications must end with 'Specification'

## Selection

Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan whose simple name ends with Specification, excluding a class named exactly Specification. No marker is involved - only the name selects.

## Check

Each resides in a domain package of some module root (<module>.domain..). An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-interface types anywhere under scan whose simple name ends with Specification, excluding a type named exactly Specification. No marker is involved - only the name selects.

**Check.** Each resides in a domain namespace of some module root (<module>.Domain or below). An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-ADV-017",
        "Specifications must end with 'Specification'",
        "Specification implementations are part of the domain layer",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith("Specification")
                .and()
                .areNotInterfaces()
                .and()
                .doNotHaveSimpleName("Specification")
                .should()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allDomainPatterns())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan whose simple name ends with"
            + " Specification, excluding a class named exactly Specification. No marker is involved - only"
            + " the name selects.")
    .checking(
        "Each resides in a domain package of some module root (<module>.domain..). An empty selection"
            + " passes.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allDomainPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
### C# expression

```csharp

    arch => Types()
        .That()
        .HaveNameEndingWith("Specification")
        .And()
        .FollowCustomPredicate(t => t is not Interface, "are not interfaces")
        .And()
        .DoNotHaveName("Specification")
        .Should()
        .ResideInNamespaceMatching(DcaLayout.AnyOf(arch.AllDomainPatterns())))
    .Selecting(
        "Non-interface types anywhere under scan whose simple name ends with Specification, "
        + "excluding a type named exactly Specification. No marker is involved - only the name "
        + "selects.")
    .Checking(
        "Each resides in a domain namespace of some module root (<module>.Domain or below). An "
