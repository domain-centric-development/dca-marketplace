# Specifications reside in the domain layer

## Selection

Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to the configured specification role or whose simple name ends with Specification, the role's own type and a class named exactly Specification excluded. The marker and the name both select, so a specification named after the predicate it expresses is governed too.

## Check

Each resides in a domain package of some module root (<module>.domain..). An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-interface types anywhere under scan that are assignable to the configured specification role or whose simple name ends with Specification, the role's own type and a type named exactly Specification excluded. The marker and the name both select, so a specification named after the predicate it expresses is governed too.

**Check.** Each resides in a domain namespace of some module root (<module>.Domain or below). An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-ADV-017",
        "Specifications reside in the domain layer",
        "A specification is a rule of the model expressed as a predicate; it belongs where the"
            + " model is, not in the layer that happens to ask the question",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that(
                    specifications(
                        arch.layout().markers(), arch.layout().specificationSuffix()))
                .should()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allDomainPatterns())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to the"
            + " configured specification role or whose simple name ends with Specification, the"
            + " role's own type and a class named exactly Specification excluded. The marker"
            + " and the name both select, so a specification named after the predicate it"
            + " expresses is governed too.")
    .checking(
        "Each resides in a domain package of some module root (<module>.domain..). An empty selection"
            + " passes.",
        "move the specification into the module's domain package")
```

## Helpers

### `specifications`

```java
/**
   * A specification: assignable to the configured role, or named after the pattern. Both select,
   * because a project may carry the marker without the suffix — as both reference samples do — or
   * the suffix without the marker.
   */
  private static DescribedPredicate<JavaClass> specifications(DcaMarkers markers, String suffix) {
    DescribedPredicate<JavaClass> byRole =
        JavaClass.Predicates.assignableTo(markers.specification());
    DescribedPredicate<JavaClass> byName = JavaClass.Predicates.simpleNameEndingWith(suffix);
    return byRole
        .or(byName)
        .and(DescribedPredicate.not(JavaClass.Predicates.INTERFACES))
        .and(DescribedPredicate.not(JavaClass.Predicates.simpleName(suffix)))
        .and(
            DescribedPredicate.not(
                DescribedPredicate.describe(
                    "the role's own type", c -> c.getName().equals(markers.specification()))))
        .as("specifications");
  }
```

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allDomainPatterns()`, `layout()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
