# Types carrying the factory role are named *Factory

## Selection

Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to Factory.

## Check

The simple name ends with Factory. Only the suffix is checked. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-interface types anywhere under scan that are assignable to IFactory.

**Check.** The simple name ends with Factory. Only the suffix is checked. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-ADV-013",
        "Types carrying the factory role are named *Factory",
        "A factory is found by its role, and read by its name: a type that creates aggregates"
            + " and is not called one makes the creation site hard to find in review and in a"
            + " search",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .areAssignableTo(arch.layout().markers().factory())
                .and()
                .areNotInterfaces()
                .should()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith(arch.layout().factorySuffix())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to Factory.")
    .checking(
        "The simple name ends with Factory. Only the suffix is checked. An empty selection passes.")
```

    arch => Types()
        .That()
        .FollowCustomPredicate(t => t.IsAssignableTo(arch.Layout.Markers.Factory), "are factories")
        .And()
        .FollowCustomPredicate(t => t is not Interface, "are not interfaces")
        .Should()
        .HaveNameEndingWith(arch.Layout.FactorySuffix))
    .Selecting(
