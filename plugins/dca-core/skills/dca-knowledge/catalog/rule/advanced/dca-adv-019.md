# Aggregates, entities and value objects must not use domain services

## Selection

Classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that carry the aggregate-root, entity or value role.

## Check

None of them calls a method of, reads a field of, or instantiates a type carrying the domain-service role. Holding one as a parameter or a field type is not an access and is not reported. A domain service calling another domain service is outside this selection. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types anywhere under scan that carry the aggregate-root, entity or value role.

**Check.** None of them calls a method of, or constructs, a type carrying the domain-service role. Holding one as a parameter or a field type is not a call and is not reported. A domain service calling another domain service is outside this selection. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-ADV-019",
        "Aggregates, entities and value objects must not use domain services",
        "A domain service exists for logic that spans several aggregates, so the application"
            + " calls it; a model type that reaches for one would drive another aggregate from"
            + " inside its own",
        arch ->
            noClasses()
                .that()
                .areAssignableTo(arch.layout().markers().aggregateRoot())
                .or()
                .areAssignableTo(arch.layout().markers().entity())
                .or()
                .areAssignableTo(arch.layout().markers().value())
                .should()
                .accessClassesThat()
                .areAssignableTo(arch.layout().markers().domainService())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that carry the aggregate-root, entity or"
            + " value role.")
    .checking(
        "None of them calls a method of, reads a field of, or instantiates a type carrying the"
            + " domain-service role. Holding one as a parameter or a field type is not an"
            + " access and is not reported. A domain service calling another domain service is"
            + " outside this selection. An empty selection passes.",
        "let the use case call the domain service and hand the model the result")
