# Factories must reside in domain package

## Selection

Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to Factory.

## Check

Each resides in a domain package of some module root (<module>.domain..). An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-interface types anywhere under scan that are assignable to IFactory.

**Check.** Each resides in a domain namespace of some module root (<module>.Domain or below). An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-ADV-014",
        "Factories must reside in domain package",
        "Factories are part of the domain layer (complex aggregate creation logic)",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that(arch.layout().markers().is("factory"))
                .and()
                .areNotInterfaces()
                .should(LayerConditions.be(arch.inDomain()))
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to Factory.")
    .checking(
        "Each resides in a domain package of some module root (<module>.domain..). An empty selection"
            + " passes.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `inDomain()`, `layout()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
### C# expression

```csharp
DcaRule.Of(
    "DCA-ADV-014",
    "Factories must reside in domain namespace",
    "Factories are part of the domain layer (complex aggregate creation logic)",
    arch => Types()
        .That()
        .FollowCustomPredicate(t => arch.Layout.Markers.Is(nameof(DcaMarkers.Factory), t), "are factories")
        .And()
        .FollowCustomPredicate(t => t is not Interface, "are not interfaces")
        .Should()
        .FollowCustomCondition(LayerConditions.PlacedIn(arch.InDomain, "the domain layer"), "be in the domain layer"))
    .Selecting(
        "Non-interface types anywhere under scan that are assignable to IFactory.")
    .Checking(
        "Each resides in a domain namespace of some module root (<module>.Domain or below). An "
        + "empty selection passes.")
```
