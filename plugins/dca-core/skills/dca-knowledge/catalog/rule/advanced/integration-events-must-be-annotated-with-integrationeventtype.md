## Selection

Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to IntegrationEvent - records, enums and abstract classes included.

## Check

The class itself is annotated with @IntegrationEventType. An annotation on a supertype does not count; the annotation's name and version values are not checked. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-interface types anywhere under scan that are assignable to IIntegrationEvent - records, structs and abstract classes included.

**Check.** The type itself carries [IntegrationEventType]. An attribute on a supertype does not count; the attribute's name and version values are not checked. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-ADV-005",
        "Integration Events must be annotated with IntegrationEventType",
        "@IntegrationEventType(name, version) is the contract identity of every integration event"
            + " — the serializer keys (name, version) to the class and stamps both onto the wire"
            + " envelope",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .areAssignableTo(IntegrationEvent.class)
                .and()
                .areNotInterfaces()
                .should()
                .beAnnotatedWith(IntegrationEventType.class)
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to"
            + " IntegrationEvent - records, enums and abstract classes included.")
    .checking(
        "The class itself is annotated with @IntegrationEventType. An annotation on a supertype does not"
            + " count; the annotation's name and version values are not checked. An empty selection passes.")
