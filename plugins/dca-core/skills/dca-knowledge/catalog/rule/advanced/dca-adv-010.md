# Marked domain services reside in a module domain

## Selection

Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to DomainService.

## Check

Each resides in a domain package of some module root (<module>.domain..). An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-interface types anywhere under scan that are assignable to IDomainService.

**Check.** Each resides in a domain namespace of some module root (<module>.Domain or below). An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-ADV-010",
        "Marked domain services reside in a module domain",
        "Domain services are part of the domain layer, not application layer",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .implement(DomainService.class)
                .should()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allDomainPatterns())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to"
            + " DomainService.")
    .checking(
        "Each resides in a domain package of some module root (<module>.domain..). An empty selection"
            + " passes.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allDomainPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
### C# expression

```csharp
DcaRule.Of(
    "DCA-ADV-010",
    "Marked domain services reside in a module domain",
    "Domain services are part of the domain layer, not application layer",
    arch => Types()
        .That()
        .AreAssignableTo(typeof(IDomainService))
        .And()
        .FollowCustomPredicate(t => t is not Interface, "are not interfaces")
        .Should()
        .ResideInNamespaceMatching(DcaLayout.AnyOf(arch.AllDomainPatterns())))
    .Selecting(
        "Non-interface types anywhere under scan that are assignable to IDomainService.")
    .Checking(
        "Each resides in a domain namespace of some module root (<module>.Domain or below). An "
        + "empty selection passes.")
```
