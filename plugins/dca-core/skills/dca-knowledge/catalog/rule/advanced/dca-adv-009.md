# Marked domain services reside in the configured domain service segment

## Selection

Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to DomainService.

## Check

Each resides in a package matching ..<domain subpackage>.service.. - the configured domain subpackage followed by service, anywhere in the package path, not tied to a module root. A domain service directly in domain or in domain.model is reported. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-interface types anywhere under scan that are assignable to IDomainService.

**Check.** Each resides in a namespace matching .<domain segment>.Service or below - the configured domain segment followed by Service, anywhere in the namespace path, not tied to a module root. A domain service directly in Domain or in Domain.Model is reported. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-ADV-009",
        "Marked domain services reside in the configured domain service segment",
        "Domain services implement DomainService marker and reside in domain.service packages"
            + " (named descriptively, e.g., PricingService, CartTotalCalculator)",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .implement(DomainService.class)
                .and()
                .areNotInterfaces()
                .should()
                .resideInAPackage(".." + layout.domainSubpackage() + ".service..")
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to"
            + " DomainService.")
    .checking(
        "Each resides in a package matching ..<domain subpackage>.service.. - the configured domain"
            + " subpackage followed by service, anywhere in the package path, not tied to a module root. A"
            + " domain service directly in domain or in domain.model is reported. An empty selection passes.")
```
