# Domain Services should be stateless (only final fields for dependencies)

## Selection

Non-interface classes in <module>.domain.. of every module root that are assignable to DomainService.

## Check

Every field - declared or inherited from a superclass, static fields included - is final. Field types are not inspected, so a final field holding mutable state passes. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-interface types in <module>.Domain of every module root that are assignable to IDomainService.

**Check.** Every field - declared by the type or inherited from a base type, static fields included - is readonly or const. A settable auto-property is reported through its backing field; a get-only one passes. Field types are not inspected, so a readonly field holding mutable state passes. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-ADV-012",
        "Domain Services should be stateless (only final fields for dependencies)",
        "Domain services should be stateless (only final fields for dependencies)",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .implement(DomainService.class)
                .and()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allDomainPatterns())
                .should(haveOnlyFinalFieldsIncludingInherited())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface classes in <module>.domain.. of every module root that are assignable to"
            + " DomainService.")
    .checking(
        "Every field - declared or inherited from a superclass, static fields included - is final."
            + " Field types are not inspected, so a final field holding mutable state passes. An empty"
            + " selection passes.")
```

## Helpers

### `haveOnlyFinalFieldsIncludingInherited`

```java
/**
   * Like ArchUnit's {@code haveOnlyFinalFields()}, but over {@code getAllFields()}: a mutable field
   * a domain service or factory inherits from a base class is state all the same.
   */
  private static ArchCondition<JavaClass> haveOnlyFinalFieldsIncludingInherited() {
    return new ArchCondition<>("have only final fields, inherited ones included") {
      @Override
      public void check(JavaClass item, ConditionEvents events) {
        item.getAllFields().stream()
            .filter(f -> !f.getModifiers().contains(JavaModifier.FINAL))
            .filter(f -> !f.getOwner().isEquivalentTo(Object.class))
            .forEach(
                f ->
                    events.add(
                        SimpleConditionEvent.violated(
                            item,
                            item.getSimpleName()
                                + " has non-final field '"
                                + f.getName()
                                + "'"
                                + (f.getOwner().equals(item)
                                    ? ""
                                    : " inherited from " + f.getOwner().getSimpleName()))));
      }
    };
  }
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allDomainPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
