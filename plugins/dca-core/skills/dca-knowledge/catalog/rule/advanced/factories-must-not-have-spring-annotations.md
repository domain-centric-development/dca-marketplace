## Selection

Non-interface classes in <module>.domain.. of every module root that are assignable to Factory.

## Check

None carries the configured component or service annotation directly on the class. Only these two annotations are checked - others, and meta-annotations, are not. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-interface types in <module>.Domain of every module root that are assignable to IFactory.

**Check.** Every attribute on the type itself - not on members, not inherited - has a type whose namespace lies below an allowed prefix: the configured third-party namespaces the domain may use (by default System, Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions and DomainCentric.BuildingBlocks), the building blocks, or a domain namespace of some module root. Any other attribute is a framework attribute and is reported; a type without a loadable runtime type is skipped. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-ADV-015",
        "Factories must not have Spring annotations",
        "Factories should be framework-independent",
        arch ->
            noClasses()
                .that()
                .implement(Factory.class)
                .and()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allDomainPatterns())
                .should()
                .beAnnotatedWith(layout.frameworkAnnotations().component())
                .orShould()
                .beAnnotatedWith(layout.frameworkAnnotations().service())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface classes in <module>.domain.. of every module root that are assignable to"
            + " Factory.")
    .checking(
        "None carries the configured component or service annotation directly on the class. Only these"
            + " two annotations are checked - others, and meta-annotations, are not. An empty selection"
            + " passes.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allDomainPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
