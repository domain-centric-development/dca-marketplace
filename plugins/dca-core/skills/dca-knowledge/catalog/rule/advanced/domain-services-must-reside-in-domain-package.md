## Selection

Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to DomainService.

## Check

Each resides in a domain package of some module root (<module>.domain..). An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-interface types anywhere under scan that are assignable to IDomainService.

**Check.** Each resides in a domain namespace of some module root (<module>.Domain or below). An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-ADV-010",
        "Domain Services must reside in domain package",
        "Domain services are part of the domain layer, not application layer",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .implement(DomainService.class)
                .should()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allDomainPatterns())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to"
            + " DomainService.")
    .checking(
        "Each resides in a domain package of some module root (<module>.domain..). An empty selection"
            + " passes.")
```
