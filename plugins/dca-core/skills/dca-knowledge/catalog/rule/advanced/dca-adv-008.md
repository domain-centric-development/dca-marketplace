# Domain Events must have a timestamp field

## Selection

Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to DomainEvent. IntegrationEvent does not extend DomainEvent, so an integration event is selected only when it also implements DomainEvent.

## Check

At least one field - declared by the class or inherited from a supertype, static or not, of any name - has one of the configured timestamp types, by default java.time.Instant, OffsetDateTime, ZonedDateTime or LocalDateTime; a record component of one of these types counts. LocalDate, long or Date fields do not satisfy it, and a timestamp method without a backing field does not either - which is what the rule is for, because the marker already forces the accessor. A project whose own event vocabulary wraps the timestamp in a value object names that type with withTimestampTypes. Every offender is reported in one violation; an empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-interface types anywhere under scan that are assignable to IDomainEvent. IIntegrationEvent does not extend IDomainEvent, so an integration event is selected only when it also implements IDomainEvent.

**Check.** At least one field - declared by the type or inherited from a base type, static or not, of any name - has one of the configured timestamp types, by default System.DateTimeOffset or System.DateTime; an auto-property or positional record parameter of one of these types counts through its backing field. DateOnly, TimeSpan, long or string fields do not satisfy it, and a computed property without a backing field does not either - which is what the rule is for, because the marker already forces the accessor; a project whose own event vocabulary wraps the timestamp in a value type names that type with WithTimestampTypes. A type the loader cannot resolve is read through the ArchUnitNET member model instead, which does not carry the backing fields of auto-properties. Every offender is reported in one violation; an empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.check(
        "DCA-ADV-008",
        "Domain Events must have a timestamp field",
        "An event records something that happened — without a timestamp the fact cannot be"
            + " ordered, replayed or audited",
        arch -> {
          List<String> violations =
              violations(
                  arch,
                  c ->
                      c.isAssignableTo(arch.layout().markers().domainEvent())
                          && !c.isInterface(),
                  c -> !hasTimestampField(c, arch.layout().timestampTypes()),
                  c -> c.getName() + " does not have a timestamp field");
          failIfAny(
              violations,
              "Domain Events must have a timestamp field (when did the event occur?):");
        })
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to DomainEvent."
            + " IntegrationEvent does not extend DomainEvent, so an integration event is selected only when it"
            + " also implements DomainEvent.")
    .checking(
        "At least one field - declared by the class or inherited from a supertype, static or not, of any"
            + " name - has one of the configured timestamp types, by default java.time.Instant,"
            + " OffsetDateTime, ZonedDateTime or LocalDateTime; a record component of one of these types"
            + " counts. LocalDate, long or Date fields do not satisfy it, and a timestamp method without a"
            + " backing field does not either - which is what the rule is for, because the marker already"
            + " forces the accessor. A project whose own event vocabulary wraps the timestamp in a value"
            + " object names that type with withTimestampTypes. Every offender is reported in one"
            + " violation; an empty selection passes.")
```

## Helpers

### `violations`

```java
private static List<String> violations(
    DcaArchitecture arch,
    Predicate<JavaClass> candidate,
    Predicate<JavaClass> violates,
    java.util.function.Function<JavaClass, String> message) {
  List<String> violations = new ArrayList<>();
  for (JavaClass javaClass : arch.classes()) {
    if (candidate.test(javaClass) && violates.test(javaClass)) {
      violations.add(message.apply(javaClass));
    }
  }
  return violations;
}
```

### `hasTimestampField`

```java
private static boolean hasTimestampField(JavaClass eventClass, List<String> timestampTypes) {
  return eventClass.getAllFields().stream()
      .anyMatch(f -> timestampTypes.contains(f.getRawType().getName()));
}
```

### `failIfAny`

```java
private static void failIfAny(List<String> violations, String header) {
  if (!violations.isEmpty()) {
    throw new DcaRuleViolation(header, violations);
  }
}
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `classes()`, `layout()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
