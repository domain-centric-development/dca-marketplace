checks: "At least one parameter of the method carries the aggregate-root or the entity role.

# Domain service operations take an aggregate or an entity

## Selection

Public methods declared on non-interface classes carrying the domain-service role, except the methods every object has (equals, hashCode, toString) and compiler generated ones.

## Check

At least one parameter of the method carries the aggregate-root or the entity role. Value objects and foreign facts may be passed alongside but do not satisfy the check on their own: a calculation that needs no aggregate is behaviour of the value object or the aggregate, not a domain service. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Public methods declared on non-interface types carrying the domain-service role, except the methods every object has (Equals, GetHashCode, ToString) and compiler generated ones.

**Check.** At least one parameter of the method carries the aggregate-root or the entity role. Value objects and foreign facts may be passed alongside but do not satisfy the check on their own: a calculation that needs no aggregate is behaviour of the value object or the aggregate, not a domain service. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.check(
        "DCA-ADV-020",
        "Domain service operations take an aggregate or an entity",
        "A domain service works on the model itself; an operation that only takes extracted"
            + " values moves the decision out of the domain and into its caller",
        arch -> {
          CollectedViolations collected =
              CollectedViolations.withHeader(
                  "A domain service operation takes at least one aggregate or entity");
          String aggregateRoot = arch.layout().markers().aggregateRoot();
          String entity = arch.layout().markers().entity();
          for (JavaClass type :
              arch.classes()
                  .that(
                      DescribedPredicate.describe(
                          "domain services",

                              candidate.isAssignableTo(arch.layout().markers().domainService())
                                  && !candidate.isInterface()))) {

              collected.require(

                      + method.getName()
                      + " takes no aggregate and no entity");
            }
          }

            + " generated ones.")
    .checking(
        "At least one parameter of the method carries the aggregate-root or the entity role."

## Helpers

### `CollectedViolations.check`

```java
/** Evaluates every rule, then throws all their violations at once. */
  static void check(List<ArchRule> rules, JavaClasses classes) {
    CollectedViolations collected = withoutHeader();
    rules.forEach(rule -> collected.addAll(rule, classes));
    collected.throwIfAny();
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.withHeader`

```java
/** A collector whose report starts with the given statement of what the rule demands. */
  static CollectedViolations withHeader(String header) {
    return new CollectedViolations(header);
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.require`

```java
/** Records the violation unless the condition holds. */
  void require(boolean condition, String violation) {
    if (!condition) {
      add(violation);
    }
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.throwIfAny`

```java
/**
   * Throws the collected violations as one {@link DcaRuleViolation}; nothing when there are none.
   */
  void throwIfAny() {
    if (!violations.isEmpty()) {
      throw new DcaRuleViolation(header, violations);
    }
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.withoutHeader`

```java
/** A collector whose report is the bare list of violations. */
  static CollectedViolations withoutHeader() {
    return new CollectedViolations("");
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.addAll`

```java
/**
   * Evaluates one ArchUnit rule and records each of its violation details, suffixed with the
   * explanation of what the rule was checking — the detail alone ({@code Class A depends on B})
   * does not say why that dependency is wrong.
   */
  void addAll(ArchRule rule, JavaClasses classes, String explanation) {
    for (String detail : rule.evaluate(classes).getFailureReport().getDetails()) {
      add(explanation.isEmpty() ? detail : detail + " - " + explanation);
    }
  }

/** Evaluates one ArchUnit rule and records its violation details as they are. */
  void addAll(ArchRule rule, JavaClasses classes) {
    addAll(rule, classes, "");
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.add`

```java
/** Records one violation. */
  void add(String violation) {
    violations.add(Objects.requireNonNull(violation, "violation"));
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.isEmpty`

```java
boolean isEmpty() {
  return violations.isEmpty();
}
```

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `classes()`, `layout()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
