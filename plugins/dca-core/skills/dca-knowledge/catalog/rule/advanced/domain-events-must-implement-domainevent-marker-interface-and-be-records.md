## Selection

Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to DomainEvent - directly or through a supertype.

## Check

The class is a record. A final class or an enum implementing DomainEvent is reported; interfaces are not selected. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-interface types anywhere under scan that are assignable to IDomainEvent - directly or through a supertype.

**Check.** The type is a record class or a struct (a record struct is a struct to the analysis, so any struct counts). A plain class implementing IDomainEvent is reported, sealed or not; interfaces are not selected. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-ADV-001",
        "Domain Events must implement DomainEvent Marker Interface and be records",
        "Domain events should be immutable records implementing DomainEvent (named in past tense,"
            + " e.g., ProductCreated, CartCleared)",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .implement(DomainEvent.class)
                .and()
                .areNotInterfaces()
                .should()
                .beRecords()
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to DomainEvent"
            + " - directly or through a supertype.")
    .checking(
        "The class is a record. A final class or an enum implementing DomainEvent is reported; interfaces"
            + " are not selected. An empty selection passes.")
```
