## Selection

Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to DomainEvent. IntegrationEvent does not extend DomainEvent, so an integration event is selected only when it also implements DomainEvent.

## Check

At least one field - declared by the class or inherited from a supertype, static or not, of any name - has the raw type java.time.Instant, java.time.LocalDateTime or java.time.ZonedDateTime; a record component of one of these types counts. OffsetDateTime, LocalDate, long or Date fields do not satisfy it, and a timestamp method without a backing field does not either. Every offender is reported in one violation; an empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-interface types anywhere under scan that are assignable to IDomainEvent. IIntegrationEvent does not extend IDomainEvent, so an integration event is selected only when it also implements IDomainEvent.

**Check.** At least one field - declared by the type or inherited from a base type, static or not, of any name - has the type System.DateTimeOffset or System.DateTime; an auto-property or positional record parameter of one of these types counts through its backing field. DateOnly, TimeSpan, long or string fields do not satisfy it, and a computed property without a backing field does not either. Every offender is reported in one violation; an empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.check(
        "DCA-ADV-008",
        "Domain Events must have a timestamp field",
        "An event records something that happened — without a timestamp the fact cannot be"
            + " ordered, replayed or audited",
        arch -> {
          List<String> violations =
              violations(
                  arch,
                  c -> c.isAssignableTo(DomainEvent.class) && !c.isInterface(),
                  c -> !hasTimestampField(c),
                  c -> c.getName() + " does not have a timestamp field");
          failIfAny(
              violations,
              "Domain Events must have a timestamp field (when did the event occur?):");
        })
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to DomainEvent."
            + " IntegrationEvent does not extend DomainEvent, so an integration event is selected only when it"
            + " also implements DomainEvent.")
    .checking(
        "At least one field - declared by the class or inherited from a supertype, static or not, of any"
            + " name - has the raw type java.time.Instant, java.time.LocalDateTime or java.time.ZonedDateTime;"
            + " a record component of one of these types counts. OffsetDateTime, LocalDate, long or Date"
            + " fields do not satisfy it, and a timestamp method without a backing field does not either."
            + " Every offender is reported in one violation; an empty selection passes.")
```

## Helpers

### `violations`

```java
private static List<String> violations(
    DcaArchitecture arch,
    Predicate<JavaClass> candidate,
    Predicate<JavaClass> violates,
    java.util.function.Function<JavaClass, String> message) {
  List<String> violations = new ArrayList<>();
  for (JavaClass javaClass : arch.classes()) {
    if (candidate.test(javaClass) && violates.test(javaClass)) {
      violations.add(message.apply(javaClass));
    }
  }
  return violations;
}
```

### `hasTimestampField`

```java
private static boolean hasTimestampField(JavaClass eventClass) {
  return eventClass.getAllFields().stream()
      .anyMatch(
          f ->
              f.getRawType().isEquivalentTo(Instant.class)
                  || f.getRawType().isEquivalentTo(LocalDateTime.class)
                  || f.getRawType().isEquivalentTo(ZonedDateTime.class));
}
```

### `failIfAny`

```java
private static void failIfAny(List<String> violations, String header) {
  if (!violations.isEmpty()) {
    throw new DcaRuleViolation(header, violations);
  }
}
```
