## Selection

Non-interface, non-abstract types in <module>.Domain of every module root that are assignable to IValue and whose runtime type is in the loaded assemblies.

## Check

The type is a record class, a record struct or any other struct. A plain class implementing IValue is reported. Whether a struct is declared readonly is not checked, and an IValue type outside a domain namespace is not selected. An empty selection passes.
