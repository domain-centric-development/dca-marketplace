title: Application layer must not use persistence or transaction frameworks
rule: "The transaction boundary of a use case is drawn by a decorator around IUseCase or by the IUnitOfWork port, never by DbContext, SaveChanges, TransactionScope or IDbTransaction in the use case itself. Framework types in the application layer bind use cases to one persistence technology and hide where the boundary is; the IUnitOfWork adapter is the single place that knows how to open and commit a transaction."
constraint: Application layer must not use persistence or transaction frameworks.
