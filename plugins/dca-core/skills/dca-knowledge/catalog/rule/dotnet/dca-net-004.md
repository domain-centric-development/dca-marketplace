## Selection

Non-interface, non-abstract types in <module>.Domain of every module root that are assignable to IValue and whose runtime type is in the loaded assemblies.

## Check

Struct values must carry the readonly modifier. Classes are governed by TAC-009/010/012; equality is checked by TAC-012. An IValue outside a domain namespace is not selected.

### C# expression

```csharp
DcaRule.Check(
        "DCA-NET-004",
        "Struct value objects must be readonly",
        "Records give attribute-based equality, immutability by default and with-expressions — the C# way to write a Value Object",
        arch =>
        {
            var domain = arch.AllDomainPatterns().Select(p => new Regex(p)).ToList();
            var violations = new List<string>();
            foreach (var type in arch.Types.Where(t => domain.Any(r => r.IsMatch(t.Namespace.FullName))))

                {
                    violations.Add($"{runtime.FullName} implements IValue but is a mutable struct");
                }
