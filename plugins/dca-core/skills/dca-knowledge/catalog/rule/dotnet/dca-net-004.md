title: Struct value objects must be readonly
rule: "A struct is copied by value but its fields stay assignable unless the struct is declared readonly, so a mutating method silently changes a copy and leaves the original behind. readonly makes the compiler enforce what a Value Object promises. Whether a value object is a record, a class or a struct is not prescribed here - DCA-TAC-012 accepts any immutable type with value equality."
constraint: Struct value objects must be readonly.
selects: "Non-interface, non-abstract types in <module>.Domain of every module root that are assignable to IValue and whose runtime type is in the loaded assemblies."
checks: Struct values must carry the readonly modifier. Classes are governed by TAC-009/010/012; equality is checked by TAC-012. An IValue outside a domain namespace is not selected.

## Selection

Non-interface, non-abstract types in <module>.Domain of every module root that are assignable to IValue and whose runtime type is in the loaded assemblies.

## Check

Struct values must carry the readonly modifier. Classes are governed by TAC-009/010/012; equality is checked by TAC-012. An IValue outside a domain namespace is not selected.
