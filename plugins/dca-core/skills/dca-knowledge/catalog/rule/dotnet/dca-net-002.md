## Selection

Interfaces under the root namespace that are assignable to IInputPort or IOutputPort and whose runtime type is in the loaded assemblies.

## Check

Every public method declared on the interface itself (inherited members, property accessors and operators excluded) returns Task, Task<T>, ValueTask or ValueTask<T> exactly when its name ends with Async. Both directions are reported: an awaitable method without the suffix and a suffixed method that returns something else. An empty selection passes.
