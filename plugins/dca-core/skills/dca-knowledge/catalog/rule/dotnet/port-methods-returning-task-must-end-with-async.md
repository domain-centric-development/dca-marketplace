title: Port methods returning Task must end with Async
rule: The Async suffix is the .NET convention that tells callers a method is awaitable; ports are the contract other layers program against.
constraint: Port methods returning Task must end with Async.
selects: Interfaces under the root namespace that are assignable to IInputPort or IOutputPort and whose runtime type is in the loaded assemblies.
checks: "Every public method declared on the interface itself (inherited members, property accessors and operators excluded) returns Task, Task<T>, ValueTask or ValueTask<T> exactly when its name ends with Async. Both directions are reported: an awaitable method without the suffix and a suffixed method that returns something else. An empty selection passes."

## Selection

Interfaces under the root namespace that are assignable to IInputPort or IOutputPort and whose runtime type is in the loaded assemblies.

## Check

Every public method declared on the interface itself (inherited members, property accessors and operators excluded) returns Task, Task<T>, ValueTask or ValueTask<T> exactly when its name ends with Async. Both directions are reported: an awaitable method without the suffix and a suffixed method that returns something else. An empty selection passes.
