## Selection

Non-interface, non-abstract types anywhere under the root namespace that are assignable to IId and whose runtime type is in the loaded assemblies.

## Check

The type is a record struct: a reference type (a record class included) is reported as such, a plain struct as not being a record. Whether the struct is declared readonly is not checked. An empty selection passes.
