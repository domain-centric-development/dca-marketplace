title: The use-case contract takes an input and a CancellationToken and answers with a Task
rule: "A use case orchestrates output ports — persistence, messaging, remote systems — which are I/O-bound in .NET, so its contract is awaitable; and a host that shuts down, a cancelled request or an expired deadline must be able to stop the work, which needs a CancellationToken on the contract itself. A synchronous or non-cancellable use-case contract blocks a thread pool thread and cannot be stopped."
constraint: The use-case contract takes an input and a CancellationToken and answers with a Task.
selects: "Concrete classes under scan with loadable runtime types that implement the configured use-case role, directly, inherited or explicitly. A class that implements no such contract is not selected — which name it gives its own operations is not this rule's subject."
checks: "Every operation the use-case contract maps onto takes the input and a CancellationToken and returns Task<T>; explicit, inherited and ordinary implementations pass. With the library's own vocabulary the C# compiler already enforces the signature of IUseCase<TIn,TOut>, so the rule has something to report only where a project points the use-case role at a contract of its own. Whether a class exposes public members beyond the contract is DCA-USE-017's subject, not this one's."

## Selection

Concrete classes under scan with loadable runtime types that implement the configured use-case role, directly, inherited or explicitly. A class that implements no such contract is not selected — which name it gives its own operations is not this rule's subject.

## Check

Every operation the use-case contract maps onto takes the input and a CancellationToken and returns Task<T>; explicit, inherited and ordinary implementations pass. With the library's own vocabulary the C# compiler already enforces the signature of IUseCase<TIn,TOut>, so the rule has something to report only where a project points the use-case role at a contract of its own. Whether a class exposes public members beyond the contract is DCA-USE-017's subject, not this one's.
