checks: "The class declares exactly one public instance method named ExecuteAsync, which returns Task<T> (a plain Task is reported) and takes a CancellationToken as its last parameter.

## Selection

Non-abstract classes under the root namespace that implement IUseCase<TInput, TOutput> and whose runtime type is in the loaded assemblies - in any namespace, not only the application layer.

## Check

The class declares exactly one public instance method named ExecuteAsync, which returns Task<T> (a plain Task is reported) and takes a CancellationToken as its last parameter. Inherited methods are not counted; other public members with a different name are not reported. An empty selection passes.
