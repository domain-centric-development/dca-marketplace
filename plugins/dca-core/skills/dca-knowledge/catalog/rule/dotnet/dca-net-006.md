## Selection

Types in <module>.Application of every module root.

## Check

No dependency on a type whose full name starts with Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore, System.Transactions, System.Data, Dapper, NHibernate or MongoDB.Driver. Only these six namespace prefixes are checked - another persistence library is not reported, and the domain and adapter layers are not selected. An empty selection passes. The statement is language-neutral, but it is carried under a dotnet id: Java has no twin, where DCA-LAY-003 forbids the infrastructure packages and not the persistence API itself.
