# Exceptions declared in the application layer must extend UseCaseException or OutputPortException

## Selection

Classes in <module>.application.. of every module root that are assignable to Throwable and not to DomainException - the exception types the application layer declares itself. The base types live in the building blocks and are not selected. A subtype of DomainException declared in an application package is not selected either: it is misplaced rather than mis-based, and DCA-ERR-002 owns that case with the remedy that fits it - move the failure to the domain, do not change its base type.

## Check

Each extends UseCaseException - a failure an input port declares, raised by the use case - or OutputPortException - a failure an output port declares, raised by its adapter - directly or through an intermediate base class. Extending PortException or InputPortException directly does not count: they classify, they are not extended by a project. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types under <Module>.Application of every module root that are assignable to Exception and not to DomainException - the exception types the application layer declares itself. The base types live in the building blocks and are not selected. A subtype of DomainException declared in an application namespace is not selected either: it is misplaced rather than mis-based, and DCA-ERR-002 owns that case with the remedy that fits it - move the failure to the domain, do not change its base type.

**Check.** Each derives from UseCaseException - a failure an input port declares, raised by the use case - or OutputPortException - a failure an output port declares, raised by its adapter - directly or through an intermediate base class. Deriving from PortException or InputPortException directly does not count: they classify, they are not derived from by a project. An empty selection passes.

## Rust reading

Unpublished (dca-rust); the suite implements it. **Held by** a test, reformulated for Rust (source-test).

**Selection.** Types in every application crate that implement std::error::Error and not DomainFailure.

**Check.** Each implements UseCaseFailure or OutputPortFailure. Implementing only the classification traits PortFailure or InputPortFailure does not count: a type implements the leaf it is.

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `inApplication()`, `layout()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
