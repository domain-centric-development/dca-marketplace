# Exceptions declared in the application layer must extend UseCaseException

## Selection

Classes in <module>.application.. of every module root that are assignable to Throwable - the exception types the application layer declares itself. The base type UseCaseException lives in the building blocks and is not selected.

## Check

Each extends UseCaseException, directly or through an intermediate base class. A subtype of DomainException declared in an application package is reported here as well: a failure of the model belongs to the model. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types under <Module>.Application of every module root that are assignable to Exception - the exception types the application layer declares itself. The base type UseCaseException lives in the building blocks and is not selected.

**Check.** Each derives from UseCaseException, directly or through an intermediate base class. A subtype of DomainException declared in an application namespace is reported here as well: a failure of the model belongs to the model. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-ERR-003",
        "Exceptions declared in the application layer must extend UseCaseException",
        "A use case that cannot serve a request reports why through its type, so that one"
            + " incoming adapter can map each outcome onto its protocol and another adapter can"
            + " map the same outcome onto a different one",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allApplicationPatterns())
                .and()
                .areAssignableTo(Throwable.class)
                .should()
                .beAssignableTo(UseCaseException.class)
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Classes in <module>.application.. of every module root that are assignable to Throwable"
            + " - the exception types the application layer declares itself. The base type"
            + " UseCaseException lives in the building blocks and is not selected.")
    .checking(
        "Each extends UseCaseException, directly or through an intermediate base class. A"
            + " subtype of DomainException declared in an application package is reported here"
            + " as well: a failure of the model belongs to the model. An empty selection"
            + " passes.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allApplicationPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
