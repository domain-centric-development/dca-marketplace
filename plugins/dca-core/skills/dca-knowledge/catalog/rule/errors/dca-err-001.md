# Exceptions declared in the domain layer must extend DomainException

## Selection

Classes in <module>.domain.. of every module root that are assignable to Throwable - the exception types the domain layer declares itself. The base type DomainException lives in the building blocks and is not selected.

## Check

Each extends DomainException, directly or through an intermediate base class. Where the exception is thrown is not checked - a throw site is not part of the import model - so a guard that raises the platform's argument exception is outside this rule. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types under <Module>.Domain of every module root that are assignable to Exception - the exception types the domain layer declares itself. The base type DomainException lives in the building blocks and is not selected.

**Check.** Each derives from DomainException, directly or through an intermediate base class. Where the exception is thrown is not checked - a throw site is not part of the type model - so a guard that raises the platform's argument exception is outside this rule. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-ERR-001",
        "Exceptions declared in the domain layer must extend DomainException",
        "A failure the model raises is a broken business rule and says so through its type; a"
            + " caller that cannot tell one from the platform's own failures cannot answer"
            + " either of them properly",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allDomainPatterns())
                .and()
                .areAssignableTo(Throwable.class)
                .should()
                .beAssignableTo(DomainException.class)
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Classes in <module>.domain.. of every module root that are assignable to Throwable -"
            + " the exception types the domain layer declares itself. The base type"
            + " DomainException lives in the building blocks and is not selected.")
    .checking(
        "Each extends DomainException, directly or through an intermediate base class. Where"
            + " the exception is thrown is not checked - a throw site is not part of the import"
            + " model - so a guard that raises the platform's argument exception is outside"
            + " this rule. An empty selection passes.")
```

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allDomainPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
