# Domain and use-case exception names must stay in the language of their layer

## Selection

Classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to DomainException or to UseCaseException, the building-blocks package excluded.

## Check

The simple name ends with none of Error, Fault, Failure and contains none of Http, Status, Response. Whether the remaining name is a term of the Ubiquitous Language is not decidable here and stays with review. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types anywhere under the root namespace that are assignable to DomainException or to UseCaseException, the building-blocks namespace excluded.

**Check.** The type name ends with none of Error, Fault, Failure and contains none of Http, Status, Response. Whether the remaining name is a term of the Ubiquitous Language is not decidable here and stays with review. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.check(
        "DCA-ERR-005",
        "Domain and use-case exception names must stay in the language of their layer",
        "A failure named after a transport concept is a decision about the answer, taken in a"
            + " layer that does not know the protocol; the name should say what went wrong, not"
            + " what the caller should be told",
        arch -> {
          CollectedViolations collected =
              CollectedViolations.withHeader(
                  "DCA-ERR-005: a technical or transport word in an exception name");
          for (JavaClass type : arch.classes()) {
            if (!isProjectException(type)) {
              continue;
            }
            String name = type.getSimpleName();
            for (String suffix : FORBIDDEN_SUFFIXES) {
              collected.require(
                  !name.endsWith(suffix),
                  type.getName() + " ends with the technical suffix " + suffix);
            }
            for (String word : FORBIDDEN_WORDS) {
              collected.require(
                  !name.contains(word),
                  type.getName() + " names the transport concept " + word);
            }
          }
          collected.throwIfAny();
        })
    .selecting(
        "Classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to DomainException or"
            + " to UseCaseException, the building-blocks package excluded.")
    .checking(
        "The simple name ends with none of Error, Fault, Failure and contains none of Http,"
            + " Status, Response. Whether the remaining name is a term of the Ubiquitous"
            + " Language is not decidable here and stays with review. An empty selection"
            + " passes.")

## Helpers

### `isProjectException`

```java
/** A project's own exception type: assignable to a base type, outside the building blocks. */
  private static boolean isProjectException(JavaClass type) {
    return (type.isAssignableTo(DomainException.class)
            || type.isAssignableTo(UseCaseException.class))
        && !type.getPackageName().startsWith(BUILDING_BLOCKS_PREFIX);
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.check`

```java
/** Evaluates every rule, then throws all their violations at once. */
  static void check(List<ArchRule> rules, JavaClasses classes) {
    CollectedViolations collected = withoutHeader();
    rules.forEach(rule -> collected.addAll(rule, classes));
    collected.throwIfAny();
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.withHeader`

```java
/** A collector whose report starts with the given statement of what the rule demands. */
  static CollectedViolations withHeader(String header) {
    return new CollectedViolations(header);
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.require`

```java
/** Records the violation unless the condition holds. */
  void require(boolean condition, String violation) {
    if (!condition) {
      add(violation);
    }
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.throwIfAny`

```java
/**
   * Throws the collected violations as one {@link DcaRuleViolation}; nothing when there are none.
   */
  void throwIfAny() {
    if (!violations.isEmpty()) {
      throw new DcaRuleViolation(header, violations);
    }
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.withoutHeader`

```java
/** A collector whose report is the bare list of violations. */
  static CollectedViolations withoutHeader() {
    return new CollectedViolations("");
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.addAll`

```java
/**
   * Evaluates one ArchUnit rule and records each of its violation details, suffixed with the
   * explanation of what the rule was checking — the detail alone ({@code Class A depends on B})
   * does not say why that dependency is wrong.
   */
  void addAll(ArchRule rule, JavaClasses classes, String explanation) {
    for (String detail : rule.evaluate(classes).getFailureReport().getDetails()) {
      add(explanation.isEmpty() ? detail : detail + " - " + explanation);
    }
  }

/** Evaluates one ArchUnit rule and records its violation details as they are. */
  void addAll(ArchRule rule, JavaClasses classes) {
    addAll(rule, classes, "");
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.add`

```java
/** Records one violation. */
  void add(String violation) {
    violations.add(Objects.requireNonNull(violation, "violation"));
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.isEmpty`

```java
boolean isEmpty() {
  return violations.isEmpty();
}
```
