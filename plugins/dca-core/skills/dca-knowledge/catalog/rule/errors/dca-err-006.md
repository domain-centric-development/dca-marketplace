# Diagnostic: incoming adapters that drive a use case without translating its failures

## Selection

Non-interface classes in <module>.adapter.incoming.. of every module root that depend on a class assignable to InputPort - the adapters that drive the application.

## Check

Informational diagnostic only: lists those that depend on no class assignable to DomainException or UseCaseException and never fails. A central handler elsewhere in the adapter layer is a valid answer, and a caught type is not visible to the import model - this does not establish that an adapter translates nothing.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-interface types under <Module>.Adapter.Incoming of every module root that depend on a type assignable to IInputPort - the adapters that drive the application.

**Check.** Informational diagnostic only: lists those that depend on no type assignable to DomainException or UseCaseException and never fails. A central handler elsewhere in the adapter layer is a valid answer, and a caught type is not visible to the type model - this does not establish that an adapter translates nothing.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.informational(
        "DCA-ERR-006",
        "Diagnostic: incoming adapters that drive a use case without translating its failures",
        "An adapter that knows neither failure type either lets everything escape to a generic"
            + " handler or catches a generic type and answers every outcome the same way;"
            + " whether it does is not visible in the import model",
        arch -> {
          for (JavaClass type : arch.classes()) {
            if (type.isInterface()
                || !JavaClass.Predicates.resideInAnyPackage(arch.allIncomingAdapterPatterns())
                    .test(type)
                || !dependsOnAssignableTo(type, InputPort.class)
                || dependsOnAssignableTo(type, DomainException.class)
                || dependsOnAssignableTo(type, UseCaseException.class)) {
              continue;
            }
            System.out.println(
                "[DCA-ERR-006] "
                    + type.getName()
                    + ": drives an input port and names no failure type of the inner layers");
          }
        })
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface classes in <module>.adapter.incoming.. of every module root that depend"
            + " on a class assignable to InputPort - the adapters that drive the application.")
    .checking(
        "Informational diagnostic only: lists those that depend on no class assignable to"
            + " DomainException or UseCaseException and never fails. A central handler"
            + " elsewhere in the adapter layer is a valid answer, and a caught type is not"
            + " visible to the import model - this does not establish that an adapter"
            + " translates nothing.")
```

## Helpers

### `dependsOnAssignableTo`

```java
private static boolean dependsOnAssignableTo(JavaClass type, Class<?> target) {
  return type.getDirectDependenciesFromSelf().stream()
      .anyMatch(dependency -> dependency.getTargetClass().isAssignableTo(target));
}
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allIncomingAdapterPatterns()`, `classes()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
