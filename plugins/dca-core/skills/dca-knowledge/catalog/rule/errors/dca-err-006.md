title: "Diagnostic: incoming adapter packages that drive a use case without translating its failures"
rule: A package that drives the application and knows neither failure type nor a case of a closed result either lets everything escape to a generic handler or catches a generic type and answers every outcome the same way; whether it does is not visible in the import model. A use case may return its expected refusals as cases of a closed result instead of throwing them; a switch over those cases is the translation then. An adapter that names the abstract base of the port failures catches them generically and answers every outcome the same way.
constraint: "Diagnostic: incoming adapter packages that drive a use case without translating its failures."
selects: "Incoming adapter packages of every module root (<module>.adapter.incoming..) that hold at least one non-interface class depending on a class assignable to InputPort - the packages that drive the application."
checks: "Informational diagnostic only: when no class of the scan is assignable to DomainException or UseCaseException, it lists no package and says once that it cannot see the failures; otherwise it lists a package when no class in it - a central exception handler beside the adapters included - depends on a class assignable to DomainException or UseCaseException, nor refers to a case of a closed result, and never fails. A closed result is a sealed type that a method of an input port returns or that an input port's use-case interface binds as a type argument; its cases are its permitted subclasses, recursively. A reference to a case is read from the class file's constant pool as well as from the import model, so a pattern-matching switch whose arms never touch the bound case is seen. This is an approximation of an exhaustive switch: one reference to one case counts, whether it is a switch arm, a type test, a cast or a construction, and whether the switch covers every case is left to the compiler. A handler in a different package of the same module is not seen, and a caught type is not visible to the import model, so this does not establish that a package translates nothing. Beside the packages it lists every incoming-adapter class that refers - through the import model or its class file's constant pool, where a catch clause's type is recorded - to the abstract bases PortException, InputPortException or OutputPortException themselves: it catches or tests the port failures generically."

# Diagnostic: incoming adapter packages that drive a use case without translating its failures

## Selection

Incoming adapter packages of every module root (<module>.adapter.incoming..) that hold at least one non-interface class depending on a class assignable to InputPort - the packages that drive the application.

## Check

Informational diagnostic only: when no class of the scan is assignable to DomainException or UseCaseException, it lists no package and says once that it cannot see the failures; otherwise it lists a package when no class in it - a central exception handler beside the adapters included - depends on a class assignable to DomainException or UseCaseException, nor refers to a case of a closed result, and never fails. A closed result is a sealed type that a method of an input port returns or that an input port's use-case interface binds as a type argument; its cases are its permitted subclasses, recursively. A reference to a case is read from the class file's constant pool as well as from the import model, so a pattern-matching switch whose arms never touch the bound case is seen. This is an approximation of an exhaustive switch: one reference to one case counts, whether it is a switch arm, a type test, a cast or a construction, and whether the switch covers every case is left to the compiler. A handler in a different package of the same module is not seen, and a caught type is not visible to the import model, so this does not establish that a package translates nothing. Beside the packages it lists every incoming-adapter class that refers - through the import model or its class file's constant pool, where a catch clause's type is recorded - to the abstract bases PortException, InputPortException or OutputPortException themselves: it catches or tests the port failures generically.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Incoming adapter namespaces of every module root (<Module>.Adapter.Incoming) that hold at least one non-interface type depending on a type assignable to IInputPort - the namespaces that drive the application.

**Check.** Informational diagnostic only: when no type of the scan is assignable to DomainException or UseCaseException, it lists no namespace and says once that it cannot see the failures; otherwise it lists a namespace when no type in it - a central exception handler beside the adapters included - depends on a type assignable to DomainException or UseCaseException, nor on a case of a closed result, and never fails. A closed result is a type an input port answers with - a type argument of its use-case interface or the return type of one of its methods, a task unwrapped - that derives from one of the configured closed-result base types (FrameworkTypes.ClosedResultBaseTypes, matched by name; every preset names the generic base of a discriminated-union library, for example OneOf.OneOfBase); its cases are the generic arguments of that base. A type test, a cast, a case type in a function's or an action's signature (one handler per case) and a member call on the union base that names its cases all count, so this approximates an exhaustive switch: one reference to one case counts, and whether every case is handled is left to the compiler. A handler in a different namespace of the same module is not seen, and a caught type is not visible to the type model, so this does not establish that a namespace translates nothing. Beside the namespaces it lists every incoming-adapter type that catches - read from the exception-handling clauses of its methods' bodies, compiler-generated nested types such as async state machines included - or refers to the abstract bases PortException, InputPortException or OutputPortException themselves: it handles the port failures generically.

## Rust reading

Unpublished (dca-rust); the suite implements it. **Held by** a lint or a test (source-test).

**Selection.** Modules in the incoming part of every adapters crate that name an input port.

**Check.** Informational - lists a module when no item in it names a DomainFailure or UseCaseFailure type nor a variant of a closed result, and never fails. A closed result is an enum an input-port trait answers with - named in an associated-type binding of its bounds (Output = ...) or in a method's return type, through any wrapper such as Result. A variant counts when a path names it through its enum or through a use of it, so a match over the variants is seen; whether the match is exhaustive is left to the compiler. When the workspace has neither a failure type nor a closed result, nothing is listed. It also lists a module that names one of the classification traits PortFailure, InputPortFailure or OutputPortFailure itself - a bound or a trait object over the base is the generic handler that answers every outcome the same way.

## Implementation

The verbatim ArchUnit expression is in the evidence slice [Overview](/evidence/rule/errors/dca-err-006/overview.md); every helper it calls has a slice of its own, listed under *Evidence slices* below.

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `classes()`, `inIncomingAdapter()`, `layout()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
