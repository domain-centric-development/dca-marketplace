# Diagnostic: incoming adapter packages that drive a use case without translating its failures

## Selection

Incoming adapter packages of every module root (<module>.adapter.incoming..) that hold at least one non-interface class depending on a class assignable to InputPort - the packages that drive the application.

## Check

Informational diagnostic only: lists a package when no class in it - a central exception handler beside the adapters included - depends on a class assignable to DomainException or UseCaseException, and never fails. A handler in a different package of the same module is not seen, and a caught type is not visible to the import model, so this does not establish that a package translates nothing.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Incoming adapter namespaces of every module root (<Module>.Adapter.Incoming) that hold at least one non-interface type depending on a type assignable to IInputPort - the namespaces that drive the application.

**Check.** Informational diagnostic only: lists a namespace when no type in it - a central exception handler beside the adapters included - depends on a type assignable to DomainException or UseCaseException, and never fails. A handler in a different namespace of the same module is not seen, and a caught type is not visible to the type model, so this does not establish that a namespace translates nothing.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.informational(
        "DCA-ERR-006",
        "Diagnostic: incoming adapter packages that drive a use case without translating its"
            + " failures",
        "A package that drives the application and knows neither failure type either lets"
            + " everything escape to a generic handler or catches a generic type and answers"
            + " every outcome the same way; whether it does is not visible in the import model",
        arch -> {
          Map<String, List<JavaClass>> drivingByPackage = new TreeMap<>();
          Set<String> packagesThatName = new HashSet<>();
          for (JavaClass type : arch.classes()) {
            if (!JavaClass.Predicates.resideInAnyPackage(arch.allIncomingAdapterPatterns())
                .test(type)) {
              continue;
            }
            if (dependsOnAssignableTo(type, DomainException.class)
                || dependsOnAssignableTo(type, UseCaseException.class)) {
              packagesThatName.add(type.getPackageName());
            }
            if (!type.isInterface() && dependsOnAssignableTo(type, InputPort.class)) {
              drivingByPackage
                  .computeIfAbsent(type.getPackageName(), pkg -> new ArrayList<>())
                  .add(type);
            }
          }
          drivingByPackage.forEach(
              (pkg, driving) -> {
                if (packagesThatName.contains(pkg)) {
                  return;
                }
                System.out.println(
                    "[DCA-ERR-006] "
                        + pkg
                        + ": drives an input port and names no failure type of the inner layers"
                        + " ("
                        + driving.stream().map(JavaClass::getSimpleName).sorted().toList()
                        + ")");
              });
        })
    .selecting(
        "Incoming adapter packages of every module root (<module>.adapter.incoming..) that hold"
            + " at least one non-interface class depending on a class assignable to InputPort -"
            + " the packages that drive the application.")
    .checking(
        "Informational diagnostic only: lists a package when no class in it - a central"
            + " exception handler beside the adapters included - depends on a class assignable"
            + " to DomainException or UseCaseException, and never fails. A handler in a"
            + " different package of the same module is not seen, and a caught type is not"
            + " visible to the import model, so this does not establish that a package"
            + " translates nothing.")
```

## Helpers

### `dependsOnAssignableTo`

```java
private static boolean dependsOnAssignableTo(JavaClass type, Class<?> target) {
  return type.getDirectDependenciesFromSelf().stream()
      .anyMatch(dependency -> dependency.getTargetClass().isAssignableTo(target));
}
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allIncomingAdapterPatterns()`, `classes()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
