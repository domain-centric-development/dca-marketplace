# Domain and use-case exceptions reside in the layer whose failure they name

## Selection

Classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to the domain-exception or the use-case-exception role, except the vocabulary's own code: the packages the configured role types live in are excluded, so a project's own base class is not reported as residing outside a layer it never claimed.

## Check

A subtype of DomainException resides in <module>.domain.. of some module root, a subtype of UseCaseException in <module>.application... Both findings are collected into one violation. Which of the two a given failure should have been is not checked here. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types anywhere under the root namespace that are assignable to DomainException or to UseCaseException, except the two base types themselves and anything else in the building-blocks namespace.

**Check.** A subtype of DomainException resides under <Module>.Domain of some module root, a subtype of UseCaseException under <Module>.Application. Both findings are collected into one violation. Which of the two a given failure should have been is not checked here. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.check(
        "DCA-ERR-002",
        "Domain and use-case exceptions reside in the layer whose failure they name",
        "The base type states which layer owns the failure; declaring it elsewhere puts the"
            + " vocabulary of that layer outside it and lets an adapter invent failures the"
            + " application never reports",
        arch -> {
          CollectedViolations collected =
              CollectedViolations.withHeader(
                  "An exception resides outside the layer its base type names");
          collected.addAll(
              classes()
                  .that()
                  .areAssignableTo(arch.layout().markers().domainException())
                  .and()
                  .resideOutsideOfPackages(
                      arch.layout().markers().declaringPackagePatterns().toArray(String[]::new))
                  .should()
                  .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allDomainPatterns())
                  .allowEmptyShould(true),
              arch.classes(),
              "a domain exception belongs to the domain layer");

                  .resideOutsideOfPackages(
                      arch.layout().markers().declaringPackagePatterns().toArray(String[]::new))

          collected.throwIfAny();
        })
    .selecting(
        "Classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to the domain-exception"
            + " or the use-case-exception role, except the vocabulary's own code: the packages the"
            + " configured role types live in are excluded, so a project's own base class is not"
            + " reported as residing outside a layer it never claimed.")
    .checking(
        "A subtype of DomainException resides in <module>.domain.. of some module root, a"
            + " subtype of UseCaseException in <module>.application... Both findings are"
            + " collected into one violation. Which of the two a given failure should have been"

## Helpers

### `CollectedViolations.check`

```java
/** Evaluates every rule, then throws all their violations at once. */
  static void check(List<ArchRule> rules, JavaClasses classes) {
    CollectedViolations collected = withoutHeader();
    rules.forEach(rule -> collected.addAll(rule, classes));
    collected.throwIfAny();
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.withHeader`

```java
/** A collector whose report starts with the given statement of what the rule demands. */
  static CollectedViolations withHeader(String header) {
    return new CollectedViolations(header);
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.addAll`

```java
/**
   * Evaluates one ArchUnit rule and records each of its violation details, suffixed with the
   * explanation of what the rule was checking — the detail alone ({@code Class A depends on B})
   * does not say why that dependency is wrong.
   */
  void addAll(ArchRule rule, JavaClasses classes, String explanation) {
    for (String detail : rule.evaluate(classes).getFailureReport().getDetails()) {
      add(explanation.isEmpty() ? detail : detail + " - " + explanation);
    }
  }

/** Evaluates one ArchUnit rule and records its violation details as they are. */
  void addAll(ArchRule rule, JavaClasses classes) {
    addAll(rule, classes, "");
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.throwIfAny`

```java
/**
   * Throws the collected violations as one {@link DcaRuleViolation}; nothing when there are none.
   */
  void throwIfAny() {
    if (!violations.isEmpty()) {
      throw new DcaRuleViolation(header, violations);
    }
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.withoutHeader`

```java
/** A collector whose report is the bare list of violations. */
  static CollectedViolations withoutHeader() {
    return new CollectedViolations("");
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.add`

```java
/** Records one violation. */
  void add(String violation) {
    violations.add(Objects.requireNonNull(violation, "violation"));
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.isEmpty`

```java
boolean isEmpty() {
  return violations.isEmpty();
}
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allApplicationPatterns()`, `allDomainPatterns()`, `classes()`, `layout()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
