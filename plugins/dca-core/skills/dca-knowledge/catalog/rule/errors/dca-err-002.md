# Domain and port exceptions reside in the layer whose failure they name

## Selection

Classes anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to the domain-exception or the port-exception role, except the vocabulary's own code: the packages the configured role types live in are excluded, so a project's own base class is not reported as residing outside a layer it never claimed.

## Check

A subtype of DomainException resides in <module>.domain.. of some module root, a subtype of PortException - UseCaseException, OutputPortException and any other port failure - in <module>.application... An output port's failure is declared beside the port, even though the adapter that implements the port raises it. Both findings are collected into one violation. Which of the two a given failure should have been is not checked here. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types anywhere under the root namespace that are assignable to DomainException or to PortException, except the base types themselves and anything else in the building-blocks namespace.

**Check.** A subtype of DomainException resides under <Module>.Domain of some module root, a subtype of PortException - UseCaseException, OutputPortException and any other port failure - under <Module>.Application. An output port's failure is declared beside the port, even though the adapter that implements the port raises it. Both findings are collected into one violation. Which of the two a given failure should have been is not checked here. An empty selection passes.

## Rust reading

Unpublished (dca-rust); the suite implements it. **Held by** a lint or a test (source-test).

**Selection.** Types that implement DomainFailure or a port failure (UseCaseFailure, OutputPortFailure, or the classification traits PortFailure and InputPortFailure).

**Check.** A DomainFailure sits in a domain crate, a port failure in an application crate - an output port's failure beside the port, although the adapter that implements the port returns it.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.check(
        "DCA-ERR-002",
        "Domain and port exceptions reside in the layer whose failure they name",
        "The base type states which layer owns the failure; declaring it elsewhere puts the"
            + " vocabulary of that layer outside it and lets an adapter invent failures the"
            + " application never reports",
        arch -> {
          CollectedViolations collected =
              CollectedViolations.withHeader(
                  "An exception resides outside the layer its base type names");
          collected.addAll(
              classes()

                  .allowEmptyShould(true),
              arch.classes(),

                  .allowEmptyShould(true),

            + " or the port-exception role, except the vocabulary's own code: the packages the"
            + " configured role types live in are excluded, so a project's own base class is not"
            + " reported as residing outside a layer it never claimed.")
    .checking(
        "A subtype of DomainException resides in <module>.domain.. of some module root, a"
            + " subtype of PortException - UseCaseException, OutputPortException and any other"

## Helpers

### `CollectedViolations.check`

```java
/** Evaluates every rule, then throws all their violations at once. */
  static void check(List<ArchRule> rules, JavaClasses classes) {
    CollectedViolations collected = withoutHeader();
    rules.forEach(rule -> collected.addAll(rule, classes));
    collected.throwIfAny();
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.withHeader`

```java
/** A collector whose report starts with the given statement of what the rule demands. */
  static CollectedViolations withHeader(String header) {
    return new CollectedViolations(header);
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.addAll`

```java
/**
   * Evaluates one ArchUnit rule and records each of its violation details, suffixed with the
   * explanation of what the rule was checking — the detail alone ({@code Class A depends on B})
   * does not say why that dependency is wrong.
   */
  void addAll(ArchRule rule, JavaClasses classes, String explanation) {
    for (String detail : rule.evaluate(classes).getFailureReport().getDetails()) {
      add(explanation.isEmpty() ? detail : detail + " - " + explanation);
    }
  }

/** Evaluates one ArchUnit rule and records its violation details as they are. */
  void addAll(ArchRule rule, JavaClasses classes) {
    addAll(rule, classes, "");
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.throwIfAny`

```java
/**
   * Throws the collected violations as one {@link DcaRuleViolation}; nothing when there are none.
   */
  void throwIfAny() {
    if (!violations.isEmpty()) {
      throw new DcaRuleViolation(header, violations);
    }
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.withoutHeader`

```java
/** A collector whose report is the bare list of violations. */
  static CollectedViolations withoutHeader() {
    return new CollectedViolations("");
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.add`

```java
/** Records one violation. */
  void add(String violation) {
    violations.add(Objects.requireNonNull(violation, "violation"));
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.isEmpty`

```java
boolean isEmpty() {
  return violations.isEmpty();
}
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `classes()`, `inApplication()`, `inDomain()`, `layout()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
