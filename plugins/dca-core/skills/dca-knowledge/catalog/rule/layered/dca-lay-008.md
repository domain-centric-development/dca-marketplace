title: Application layer must not use persistence or transaction APIs
rule: "A use case declares its transaction with the configured transactional annotation or draws its boundary through the transaction-boundary port or a decorator around the use case, never through a persistence context, a connection or a transaction scope of its own. A persistence or transaction API in the application layer binds the use cases to one persistence technology and hides where the boundary is; the boundary's implementation is the single place that knows how to open and commit a transaction."
constraint: Application layer must not use persistence or transaction APIs.
selects: Types the layout places in the application layer of every module root.
checks: "No dependency on a type whose fully qualified name starts with one of the configured persistence and transaction API prefixes - in a signature, a field, an annotation or a method body. The configured transactional annotation, which DCA-LAY-004 places in the application layer, passes, and so do the types nested in it: a use case may declare its transaction. A transaction drawn programmatically - a transaction scope, a user transaction, a connection - is reported; it goes through the transaction-boundary port. The default names the platform's common persistence, data-access and transaction APIs; another persistence library is not reported unless the layout setting for persistence APIs names it, and the domain and adapter layers are not selected. An empty list checks nothing; an empty selection passes."

# Application layer must not use persistence or transaction APIs

**Experimental.** This rule is binding only in a project that opted in to experimental rules - the architecture test calls `withExperimental()` (.NET: `WithExperimental()`) on its rule selection, or `dca-archunit.properties` sets `dca.rules.experimental = true`; without that opt-in the rule does not run and is information only, never a finding and never a reason to change code.

## Selection

Types the layout places in the application layer of every module root.

## Check

No dependency on a type whose fully qualified name starts with one of the configured persistence and transaction API prefixes - in a signature, a field, an annotation or a method body. The configured transactional annotation, which DCA-LAY-004 places in the application layer, passes, and so do the types nested in it: a use case may declare its transaction. A transaction drawn programmatically - a transaction scope, a user transaction, a connection - is reported; it goes through the transaction-boundary port. The default names the platform's common persistence, data-access and transaction APIs; another persistence library is not reported unless the layout setting for persistence APIs names it, and the domain and adapter layers are not selected. An empty list checks nothing; an empty selection passes.

## Rust reading

Unpublished (dca-rust); planned, not yet implemented. **Held by** a lint or a test (source-test).

**Selection.** Every application crate.

**Check.** No dependency on a configured persistence or transaction crate (sqlx, diesel, sea-orm, rusqlite, tokio-postgres, mongodb by default). Planned: the suite does not implement it yet.

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `inApplication()`, `layout()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
