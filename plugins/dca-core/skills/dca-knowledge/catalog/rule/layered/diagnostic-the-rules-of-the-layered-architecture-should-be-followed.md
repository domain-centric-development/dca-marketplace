## Selection

Informational - selects nothing. ArchUnit's layered-architecture definition (adapter layer accesses application, application accesses domain, domain accesses nothing) is not built, because in Ports and Adapters outgoing adapters implement application-level output ports.

## Check

Informational - selects nothing and never fails; it carries doctrine only. The dependency direction is enforced by the hexagonal rules.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Informational - selects nothing. A classic layered-architecture definition (adapter layer accesses application, application accesses domain, domain accesses nothing) is not built, because in Ports and Adapters outgoing adapters implement application-level output ports.

**Check.** Informational - selects nothing and never fails; it carries doctrine only. The dependency direction is enforced by the hexagonal rules.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.check(
        "DCA-LAY-001",
        "Diagnostic: The rules of the Layered Architecture should be followed",
        "Traditional layering (application accessed only by incoming adapters) contradicts Ports"
            + " and Adapters, where outgoing adapters implement application-level output ports;"
            + " the hexagonal rules cover the intended dependency direction",
        arch -> {})
    .selecting(
        "Informational - selects nothing. ArchUnit's layered-architecture definition (adapter"
            + " layer accesses application, application accesses domain, domain accesses"
            + " nothing) is not built, because in Ports and Adapters outgoing adapters"
            + " implement application-level output ports.")
    .checking(
        "Informational - selects nothing and never fails; it carries doctrine only. The"
            + " dependency direction is enforced by the hexagonal rules.")
```
