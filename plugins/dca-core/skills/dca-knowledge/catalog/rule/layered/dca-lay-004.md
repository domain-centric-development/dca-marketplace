# Transaction boundaries belong to the application layer

## Selection

Three selections. Declarative: methods and classes under scan that carry one of the configured transactional annotations directly (meta-annotations do not count). Transaction use: classes under scan that depend on one of the configured transaction-API types (role transactionApi - a transaction template or user transaction, the types code runs a transaction with). Wiring: classes under scan that depend on one of the configured transaction-manager types (role transactionManager) or on TransactionBoundary. A dependency counts at any depth (field, parameter, call); implementations of TransactionBoundary itself are never selected. With the roles empty only TransactionBoundary dependencies are selected.

## Check

Annotations and transaction use: the method is declared in, or the class resides in, an application package of some module root (<module>.application..) or an outgoing adapter package (..adapter.outgoing..) anywhere - a domain, incoming-adapter or infrastructure package is reported, the global infrastructure package included. Wiring: additionally allowed in the global infrastructure package (<base>.infrastructure.., the composition root that declares the manager) and in the shared kernel's infrastructure package (<base>.sharedkernel.infrastructure.., plumbing that hooks into the boundary); a domain, incoming-adapter or module-infrastructure package is reported. All findings are collected into one violation. Where manager and boundary dependencies are allowed the rule cannot tell wiring from a call: a class in the global or shared-kernel infrastructure package that obtains the manager and begins a transaction itself passes. Which transaction a boundary opens is not checked.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Three selections. Declarative: types under scan that carry the configured transactional attribute, and types that declare a method carrying it - empty by default, because neither .NET preset configures one. Transaction use: types under scan that depend on a configured transaction-API type - TransactionScope (by default System.Transactions.TransactionScope) or one of the TransactionApiTypes (by default CommittableTransaction, IDbTransaction, DbTransaction and the persistence library's IDbContextTransaction), the types code runs a transaction with. Wiring: types under scan that depend on one of the TransactionManagerTypes (empty by default) or on ITransactionBoundary. A field, a local, a method call or a using block all count; implementations of ITransactionBoundary itself are never selected. With no transaction type configured only ITransactionBoundary dependencies are selected.

**Check.** Declarative: the type resides in an application namespace of some module root or in an outgoing adapter namespace of some module root - the same places the transaction API is allowed, as in the Java twin. With no transactional attribute configured this selection is empty and the rule checks the other two only. Transaction use: the type resides in an application namespace of some module root (<module>.Application or below) or in an outgoing adapter namespace of some module root (<module>.Adapter.Outgoing or below) - a domain, incoming-adapter or infrastructure namespace is reported, the global one included. Wiring: additionally allowed in the global infrastructure namespace (<Root>.Infrastructure, the composition root that declares the manager) and in the shared kernel's infrastructure namespace (<Root>.SharedKernel.Infrastructure, plumbing that hooks into the boundary); a domain, incoming-adapter or module-infrastructure namespace is reported. One finding per type and transaction type, all collected into one violation. The check is per type, not per method. Where manager and boundary dependencies are allowed the rule cannot tell wiring from a call: a type in the global or shared-kernel infrastructure namespace that obtains the manager and begins a transaction itself passes. Which transaction a boundary opens is not checked.

## Implementation

The verbatim ArchUnit expression is in the evidence slice [Overview](/evidence/rule/layered/dca-lay-004/overview.md); every helper it calls has a slice of its own, listed under *Evidence slices* below.

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allApplicationPatterns()`, `classes()`, `layout()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
