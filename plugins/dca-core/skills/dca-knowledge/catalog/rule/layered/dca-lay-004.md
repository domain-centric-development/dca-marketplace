# Transaction boundaries belong to the application layer

## Selection

Two mechanisms. Declarative: methods and classes under scan that carry one of the configured transactional annotations directly (meta-annotations do not count). Programmatic: classes under scan that depend on one of the configured transaction-API types (role transactionApi - a transaction template, manager or user transaction) or on TransactionBoundary, at any depth of the dependency (field, parameter, call); implementations of TransactionBoundary itself and classes in the global infrastructure package (<base>.infrastructure.., the composition root that wires the transaction manager) are not selected. With both roles empty only TransactionBoundary dependencies are selected.

## Check

Each annotated method is declared in, and each annotated class and each dependent class resides in, an application package of some module root (<module>.application..) or an outgoing adapter package (..adapter.outgoing..) anywhere. An annotation in a domain, incoming-adapter or infrastructure package is reported; a transaction-API or TransactionBoundary dependency in a domain, incoming-adapter or module-infrastructure package is reported; all findings are collected into one violation. Which transaction a boundary opens is not checked.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types under scan that have any dependency on a configured transaction type - TransactionScope (by default System.Transactions.TransactionScope) or one of the TransactionApiTypes (by default CommittableTransaction, IDbTransaction, DbTransaction and the persistence library's IDbContextTransaction) - or on ITransactionBoundary; a field, a local, a method call or a using block all count. Implementations of ITransactionBoundary itself and types in the global infrastructure namespace (<Root>.Infrastructure, the composition root that wires the transaction manager) are not selected. With no transaction type configured only ITransactionBoundary dependencies are selected.

**Check.** Each resides in an application namespace of some module root (<module>.Application or below) or in an outgoing adapter namespace of some module root (<module>.Adapter.Outgoing or below). A use in a domain, incoming-adapter or module-infrastructure namespace is reported, one finding per type and transaction type; all findings are collected into one violation. The check is per type, not per method; which transaction a boundary opens is not checked.

## Implementation

      add(explanation.isEmpty() ? detail : detail + " - " + explanation);

    }
    return predicate.as("annotated with any of " + role);
  }

static DescribedPredicate<CanBeAnnotated> annotatedWithAny(List<String>... roles) {
  DescribedPredicate<CanBeAnnotated> predicate = null;
  for (List<String> role : roles) {

  }
  return predicate == null
      ? DescribedPredicate.<CanBeAnnotated>alwaysFalse()
          .as("annotated with a configured annotation (none configured)")
      : predicate;
}
```

### `CollectedViolations.throwIfAny`

```java
/**
   * Throws the collected violations as one {@link DcaRuleViolation}; nothing when there are none.
   */
  void throwIfAny() {
    if (!violations.isEmpty()) {

boolean isEmpty() {
  return violations.isEmpty();

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allApplicationPatterns()`, `classes()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
