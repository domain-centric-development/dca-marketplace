# Transaction boundaries belong to the application layer

## Selection

Three selections. Declarative: methods and classes under scan that carry one of the configured transactional annotations directly (meta-annotations do not count). Transaction use: classes under scan that depend on one of the configured transaction-API types (role transactionApi - a transaction template or user transaction, the types code runs a transaction with). Wiring: classes under scan that depend on one of the configured transaction-manager types (role transactionManager) or on TransactionBoundary. A dependency counts at any depth (field, parameter, call); implementations of TransactionBoundary itself are never selected. With the roles empty only TransactionBoundary dependencies are selected.

## Check

Annotations and transaction use: the method is declared in, or the class resides in, an application package of some module root (<module>.application..) or an outgoing adapter package (..adapter.outgoing..) anywhere - a domain, incoming-adapter or infrastructure package is reported, the global infrastructure package included. Wiring: additionally allowed in the global infrastructure package (<base>.infrastructure.., the composition root that declares the manager) and in the shared kernel's infrastructure package (<base>.sharedkernel.infrastructure.., plumbing that hooks into the boundary); a domain, incoming-adapter or module-infrastructure package is reported. All findings are collected into one violation. Which transaction a boundary opens is not checked.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Two selections. Transaction use: types under scan that depend on a configured transaction-API type - TransactionScope (by default System.Transactions.TransactionScope) or one of the TransactionApiTypes (by default CommittableTransaction, IDbTransaction, DbTransaction and the persistence library's IDbContextTransaction), the types code runs a transaction with. Wiring: types under scan that depend on one of the TransactionManagerTypes (empty by default) or on ITransactionBoundary. A field, a local, a method call or a using block all count; implementations of ITransactionBoundary itself are never selected. With no transaction type configured only ITransactionBoundary dependencies are selected.

**Check.** Transaction use: the type resides in an application namespace of some module root (<module>.Application or below) or in an outgoing adapter namespace of some module root (<module>.Adapter.Outgoing or below) - a domain, incoming-adapter or infrastructure namespace is reported, the global one included. Wiring: additionally allowed in the global infrastructure namespace (<Root>.Infrastructure, the composition root that declares the manager) and in the shared kernel's infrastructure namespace (<Root>.SharedKernel.Infrastructure, plumbing that hooks into the boundary); a domain, incoming-adapter or module-infrastructure namespace is reported. One finding per type and transaction type, all collected into one violation. The check is per type, not per method; which transaction a boundary opens is not checked.
