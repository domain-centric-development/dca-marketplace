title: The shared kernel's output-port markers must all be interfaces
rule: "port.out contains outbound port interfaces (Repository, OutputPort, DomainEventPublisher) shared across all bounded contexts. These must be interfaces to ensure the application layer remains framework-independent and follows the Dependency Inversion Principle. Implementations belong in infrastructure or adapter packages."
constraint: The shared kernel's output-port markers must all be interfaces.
