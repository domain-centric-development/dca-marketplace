# No implementation is placed into the building-blocks output-port package

## Selection

Classes in the building-blocks package hexagonal.port.out.. on the classpath under scan.

## Check

Each is an interface. The project's own output ports in application.shared are not selected; when the building-blocks package is not imported, the rule passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types declared in the building-blocks namespace DomainCentric.BuildingBlocks.Hexagonal.Ports.Out, read from types imported in the architecture, including consumer assemblies. Compiler-generated types (closures, async state machines of default interface methods) are not selected.

**Check.** Each is an interface. The project's own output ports in Application.Shared are not selected; the rule passes when no non-interface type is found.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-LAY-005",
        "No implementation is placed into the building-blocks output-port package",
        "port.out contains outbound port interfaces (Repository, OutputPort, DomainEventPublisher)"
            + " shared across all bounded contexts. These must be interfaces to ensure the"
            + " application layer remains framework-independent and follows the Dependency"
            + " Inversion Principle. Implementations belong in infrastructure or adapter packages.",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
