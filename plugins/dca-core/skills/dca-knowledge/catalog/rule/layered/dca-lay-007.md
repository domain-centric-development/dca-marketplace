# Diagnostic: classes of a module that sit in no layer

**Experimental.** This rule is binding only in a project that opted in to experimental rules - the architecture test calls `withExperimental()` (.NET: `WithExperimental()`) on its rule selection, or `dca-archunit.properties` sets `dca.rules.experimental = true`; without that opt-in the rule does not run and is information only, never a finding and never a reason to change code.

## Selection

Classes under a module root, below its own package, that the layout places in no layer - neither by a layer annotation on the class or a package above it nor by the package path. Not selected: classes directly in the module root's package, the published packages (api, events) of a module and its own infrastructure package - the shared kernel's included, which is shared support rather than a layer.

## Check

Informational - lists every selected class and never fails. Place each in a layer: move it into the layer package it belongs to, or declare its package's layer.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types under a module root, below its own namespace, that the layout places in no layer - neither by a layer attribute on the type, its namespace or its assembly nor by the namespace path; compiler-generated types are not selected. Not selected: types directly in the module root's namespace, the published namespaces (Api, Events) of a module and its own Infrastructure namespace - the shared kernel's included, which is shared support rather than a layer.

**Check.** Informational - lists every selected type and never fails. Place each in a layer: move it into the layer namespace it belongs to, or declare its namespace's layer.

## Implementation

```java

        "Every rule written for a layer selects by the layer a class is placed in. A class of a"
            + " module that sits in none - a mapper or a persistence entity beside the adapter"
            + " packages, a class whose layer is declared only on its neighbour - is seen by"
            + " none of them",

          List<String> observed = new java.util.ArrayList<>();
          for (JavaClass type : arch.classes()) {
            String pkg = type.getPackageName();
            String root =
                arch.moduleRoots().stream()
                    .filter(r -> DcaArchitecture.inPackageTree(pkg, r))
                    .max(java.util.Comparator.comparingInt(String::length))
                    .orElse(null);

              continue;
            }
            String below = pkg.substring(root.length() + 1).split("\\.")[0];

            }
            observed.add(type.getName() + " (module " + root + ")");
          }
          return observed.stream().sorted().toList();
        })
    .experimental()
    .selecting(
        "Classes under a module root, below its own package, that the layout places in no layer"
            + " - neither by a layer annotation on the class or a package above it nor by the"

    .checking(
        "Informational - lists every selected class and never fails. Place each in a layer:"
            + " move it into the layer package it belongs to, or declare its package's layer.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `classes()`, `layout()`, `moduleRoots()`, `placement()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
