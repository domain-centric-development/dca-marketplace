// layer (transaction boundary) and in outgoing persistence adapters (multi-statement
// operations that must stay atomic even when invoked outside a use-case transaction;
// with default REQUIRED propagation they join the caller's transaction).
// It is never allowed in the domain layer or in incoming adapters.
