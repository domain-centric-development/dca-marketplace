## Selection

Non-interface classes anywhere under scan assignable to Repository, abstract base classes included.

## Check

The class resides in <module>.adapter.outgoing.. of some module root. An implementation in any other package under scan - a test double, say - is reported; an empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-interface types below the root namespace assignable to IRepository, abstract base classes included.

**Check.** The type resides in <module>.Adapter.Outgoing of some module root. An implementation anywhere else below the root - a test double, say - is reported; an empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-TAC-015",
        "Repository Implementations must reside in adapter.outgoing package",
        "Repository implementations are outgoing adapters in bounded contexts",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .areNotInterfaces()
                .and()
                .areAssignableTo(Repository.class)
                .should()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allOutgoingAdapterPatterns())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface classes anywhere under scan assignable to Repository, abstract "
            + "base classes included.")
    .checking(
        "The class resides in <module>.adapter.outgoing.. of some module root. An "
            + "implementation in any other package under scan - a test double, say - is "
            + "reported; an empty selection passes.")
```
