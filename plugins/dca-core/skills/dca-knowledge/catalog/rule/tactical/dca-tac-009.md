# Value Object classes should be final (immutability)

## Selection

Non-interface, non-record, non-enum classes in <module>.domain.model.. of every module root that are assignable to Value.

## Check

The class carries the final modifier. Records, interfaces and enums are not selected, so a record value object always passes and an enum value object is never reported - an enum with constant-specific class bodies is compiled abstract and cannot be made final. A value object outside <module>.domain.model.. is never reported, and an empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Classes - record classes included, structs and enums not - in <module>.Domain.Model of every module root that are assignable to IValue; compiler-generated classes excluded.

**Check.** The class is sealed or abstract. A non-sealed record class is reported like a non-sealed class; structs and enums are never selected and so always pass, as does a value object outside <module>.Domain.Model. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-TAC-009",
        "Value Object classes should be final (immutability)",
        "Value objects should be immutable (final classes) - Vernon's DDD recommendation",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allDomainModelPatterns())
                .and()
                .areAssignableTo(arch.layout().markers().value())
                .and()
                .areNotInterfaces()
                .and()
                .areNotRecords()
                .and()
                .areNotEnums()
                .should()
                .haveModifier(JavaModifier.FINAL)
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface, non-record, non-enum classes in <module>.domain.model.. of every "
            + "module root that are assignable to Value.")
    .checking(
        "The class carries the final modifier. Records, interfaces and enums are not "
            + "selected, so a record value object always passes and an enum value object is "
            + "never reported - an enum with constant-specific class bodies is compiled "
            + "abstract and cannot be made final. A value object outside "
            + "<module>.domain.model.. is never reported, and an empty selection passes.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allDomainModelPatterns()`, `layout()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
