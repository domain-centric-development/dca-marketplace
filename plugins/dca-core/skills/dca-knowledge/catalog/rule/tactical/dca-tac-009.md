# Value Object classes should be final (immutability)

## Selection

Non-interface, non-record classes in <module>.domain.model.. of every module root that are assignable to Value; enums included.

## Check

The class carries the final modifier. Records and interfaces are not selected, so a record value object always passes; a value object outside <module>.domain.model.. is never reported, and an empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Classes - record classes included, structs and enums not - in <module>.Domain.Model of every module root that are assignable to IValue; compiler-generated classes excluded.

**Check.** The class is sealed or abstract. A non-sealed record class is reported like a non-sealed class; structs and enums are never selected and so always pass, as does a value object outside <module>.Domain.Model. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-TAC-009",
        "Value Object classes should be final (immutability)",
        "Value objects should be immutable (final classes) - Vernon's DDD recommendation",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allDomainModelPatterns())
                .and()
                .implement(Value.class)
                .and()
                .areNotInterfaces()
                .and()
                .areNotRecords()
                .should()
                .haveModifier(JavaModifier.FINAL)
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface, non-record classes in <module>.domain.model.. of every module "
            + "root that are assignable to Value; enums included.")
    .checking(
        "The class carries the final modifier. Records and interfaces are not selected, "
            + "so a record value object always passes; a value object outside "
            + "<module>.domain.model.. is never reported, and an empty selection passes.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allDomainModelPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
### C# expression

```csharp
DcaRule.Check(
    "DCA-TAC-009",
    "Value Object classes should be sealed (immutability)",
    "Value objects should be immutable and not extensible - Vernon's DDD recommendation;"
    + " .NET: a sealed class, a sealed record, or a struct",
    arch =>
    {
        var violations = new List<string>();
        foreach (var valueObject in arch.Classes)
        {
            if (valueObject.IsCompilerGenerated
                || !ResidesInAny(valueObject, arch.AllDomainModelPatterns())
                || !IsAssignableTo(arch, valueObject, typeof(IValue)))
            {
                continue;
            }

            if (valueObject.IsSealed != true && valueObject.IsAbstract != true)
            {
                violations.Add($"{valueObject.FullName} is a Value Object {(valueObject.IsRecord == true ? "record" : "class")} that is not sealed");
            }
        }

        DcaRule.Fail("Value Object classes and records must be sealed (or be structs).", violations);
    })
    .Selecting(
        "Classes - record classes included, structs and enums not - in "
        + "<module>.Domain.Model of every module root that are assignable to IValue; "
        + "compiler-generated classes excluded.")

        "The class is sealed or abstract. A non-sealed record class is reported like "
        + "a non-sealed class; structs and enums are never selected and so always pass, "
