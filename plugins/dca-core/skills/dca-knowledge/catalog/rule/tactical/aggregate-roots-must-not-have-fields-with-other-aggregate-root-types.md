## Selection

Non-interface classes anywhere under scan assignable to AggregateRoot, abstract ones included.

## Check

No instance field - inherited ones included, walked through raw type, array component and generic type arguments, a generic base class's type parameters resolved as the aggregate binds them - involves a non-interface class assignable to AggregateRoot. A field whose own type is the inspected aggregate itself (a parent, a predecessor) is tolerated; a container of that same type is not. An interface type assignable to AggregateRoot is not reported.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-interface types below the root namespace assignable to IAggregateRoot, abstract ones included.

**Check.** No field or property - inherited ones included, walked through the member's own type, array element and generic type arguments, a generic base class's type parameters resolved as the aggregate binds them - involves a non-interface type assignable to IAggregateRoot. A member whose own type is the inspected aggregate itself (a parent, a predecessor) is tolerated; a container of that same type is not. An interface type assignable to IAggregateRoot is not reported.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.check(
        "DCA-TAC-003",
        "Aggregate Roots must not have fields with other Aggregate Root types",
        "Vernon's Aggregate Design Rule #2: reference other Aggregates by identity to keep"
            + " aggregate boundaries and transactional consistency intact",
        arch -> {
          List<String> violations = new ArrayList<>();
          for (JavaClass aggregate : concreteClassesAssignableTo(arch, AggregateRoot.class)) {
            for (JavaField field : TypeInspection.instanceFields(aggregate)) {
              for (JavaClass involved : TypeInspection.involvedTypes(field, aggregate)) {
                if (isConcreteAggregateRoot(involved)
                    && !isSelfReference(aggregate, field, involved)) {
                  violations.add(
                      fieldDescription(aggregate, field, involved)
                          + " which is another aggregate root");
                }
              }
            }
          }
          fail(
              "Aggregates must reference other aggregates by ID only (Vernon's Rule #2).",
              violations);
        })
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface classes anywhere under scan assignable to AggregateRoot, "
            + "abstract ones included.")
    .checking(
        "No instance field - inherited ones included, walked through raw type, array "
            + "component and generic type arguments, a generic base class's type parameters "
            + "resolved as the aggregate binds them - involves a non-interface class "
            + "assignable to AggregateRoot. A field whose own type is the inspected aggregate "
            + "itself (a parent, a predecessor) is tolerated; a container of that same type "
            + "is not. An interface type assignable to AggregateRoot is not reported.")

## Helpers

### `concreteClassesAssignableTo`

```java
private static List<JavaClass> concreteClassesAssignableTo(
    DcaArchitecture arch, Class<?> marker) {
  return classesMatching(arch, c -> c.isAssignableTo(marker) && !c.isInterface());
}
```

### `isConcreteAggregateRoot`

```java
private static boolean isConcreteAggregateRoot(JavaClass type) {
  return type.isAssignableTo(AggregateRoot.class) && !type.isInterface();
}
```

### `isSelfReference`

```java
/**
   * A field whose own type is the aggregate being inspected — a parent, a root, a predecessor — is
   * a self-reference and tolerated. A container of that type is not: its elements are
   * <em>other</em> instances of the aggregate, referenced by identity like any other aggregate.
   */
  private static boolean isSelfReference(JavaClass aggregate, JavaField field, JavaClass involved) {
    return involved.equals(aggregate) && involved.equals(field.getRawType());
  }
```

### `fieldDescription`

```java
/**
   * {@code Owner has field 'f' of type X} when the field's own type is the offender, {@code Owner
   * has field 'f' containing X} when it is hidden in a container or type argument.
   */

    String relation = involved.equals(field.getRawType()) ? "' of type " : "' containing ";
    return owner.getName() + " has field '" + field.getName() + relation + involved.getName();
  }
```

### `fail`

```java

  }
}
```

### `TypeInspection.instanceFields`
