# Store interfaces must extend the Store marker, not Repository

## Selection

Interfaces anywhere under scan whose simple name ends with Store, the marker Store itself excluded.

## Check

The interface is assignable to the Store marker and not assignable to Repository; both must hold. An interface not named *Store is never reported; an empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Interfaces below the root namespace whose name ends with Store; interfaces named exactly Store or IStore excluded.

**Check.** The interface is assignable to the IStore marker and not assignable to IRepository; both must hold, and each failing alone is reported. An interface not named *Store is never reported; an empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-TAC-018",
        "Store interfaces must extend the Store marker, not Repository",
        "Stores extend the Store marker; Repository is reserved for Aggregate Roots",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .areInterfaces()
                .and()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith(STORE_SUFFIX)
                .and()
                .doNotHaveSimpleName(STORE_SUFFIX)
                .should()
                .beAssignableTo(Store.class)
                .andShould()
                .notBeAssignableTo(Repository.class)
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Interfaces anywhere under scan whose simple name ends with Store, the marker "
            + "Store itself excluded.")
    .checking(
        "The interface is assignable to the Store marker and not assignable to "
            + "Repository; both must hold. An interface not named *Store is never reported; "
            + "an empty selection passes.")
```

        foreach (var candidate in arch.Interfaces)
        {
            if (!HasSuffixButIsNotMarker(candidate, StoreSuffix))
            {
                continue;
            }

            if (!IsAssignableTo(arch, candidate, typeof(IStore)))
            {
                violations.Add($"{candidate.FullName} is named *Store but does not extend {nameof(IStore)}");

            {
                violations.Add($"{candidate.FullName} is named *Store but extends {nameof(IRepository)}");
            }
        }

        DcaRule.Fail("Store interfaces must extend IStore and must not extend IRepository.", violations);
    })
    .Selecting(
        "Interfaces below the root namespace whose name ends with Store; interfaces "
        + "named exactly Store or IStore excluded.")
    .Checking(
        "The interface is assignable to the IStore marker and not assignable to "
        + "IRepository; both must hold, and each failing alone is reported. An "
