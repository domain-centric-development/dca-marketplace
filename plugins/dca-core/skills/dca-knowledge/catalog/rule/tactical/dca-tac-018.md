# Store interfaces must extend the Store marker, not Repository

## Selection

Interfaces under scan whose simple name ends with Store, the marker Store itself and the type the store role names excluded, outside every adapter and infrastructure package - an interface there is an adapter's own abstraction, never a port.

## Check

The interface is assignable to the Store marker and not assignable to Repository; both must hold. An interface not named *Store is never reported; an empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Interfaces below the root namespace whose name ends with Store, those named exactly Store or IStore and the type the Store role names excluded, outside every adapter and infrastructure namespace - an interface there is an adapter's own abstraction, never a port.

**Check.** The interface is assignable to the IStore marker and not assignable to IRepository; both must hold, and each failing alone is reported. An interface not named *Store is never reported; an empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-TAC-018",
        "Store interfaces must extend the Store marker, not Repository",
        "Stores extend the Store marker; Repository is reserved for Aggregate Roots",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .areInterfaces()
                .and()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith(arch.layout().storeSuffix())
                .and()
                .doNotHaveSimpleName(arch.layout().storeSuffix())
                .and()
                .doNotHaveFullyQualifiedName(arch.layout().markers().store())
                .and()
                .resideOutsideOfPackages(arch.allAdapterPatterns())
                .and()
                .resideOutsideOfPackages(arch.allInfrastructurePatterns())
                .should()
                .beAssignableTo(arch.layout().markers().store())
                .andShould()
                .notBeAssignableTo(arch.layout().markers().repository())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Interfaces under scan whose simple name ends with Store, the marker Store itself"
            + " and the type the store role names excluded, outside every adapter and"
            + " infrastructure package - an interface there is an adapter's own abstraction,"
            + " never a port.")
    .checking(
        "The interface is assignable to the Store marker and not assignable to "
            + "Repository; both must hold. An interface not named *Store is never reported; "
            + "an empty selection passes.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allAdapterPatterns()`, `allInfrastructurePatterns()`, `layout()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
