# Store interfaces must reside in the application layer (local to a use case or shared)

## Selection

Interfaces anywhere under scan assignable to Store, whatever their name, the marker Store itself excluded.

## Check

The interface resides in <module>.application.. of some module root, the shared kernel's included. Implementations are not selected; an empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Interfaces below the root namespace assignable to IStore, whatever their name; an interface named exactly Store excluded.

**Check.** The interface resides in <module>.Application of some module root, the shared kernel's included. Implementations are not selected; an empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-TAC-019",
        "Store interfaces must reside in the application layer (local to a use case or shared)",
        "Store interfaces are output ports in the application layer (Hexagonal Architecture)",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .areInterfaces()
                .and()
                .areAssignableTo(Store.class)
                .and()
                .doNotHaveSimpleName(STORE_SUFFIX)
                .should()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allApplicationPatterns())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Interfaces anywhere under scan assignable to Store, whatever their name, the "
            + "marker Store itself excluded.")
    .checking(
        "The interface resides in <module>.application.. of some module root, "
            + "the shared kernel's included. Implementations are not selected; an empty "
            + "selection passes.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allApplicationPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
### C# expression

```csharp
DcaRule.Check(
    "DCA-TAC-019",
    "Store interfaces must reside in the application layer (local to a use case or shared)",
    "Store interfaces are output ports in the application layer (Hexagonal Architecture)",
    arch => RequireNamespace(StoreInterfaces(arch), DcaLayout.AnyOf(arch.AllApplicationPatterns()), "Store interfaces", "an application namespace of its module (use-case-local or Shared)"))
    .Selecting(
        "Interfaces below the root namespace assignable to IStore, whatever their "
        + "name; an interface named exactly Store excluded.")
    .Checking(
        "The interface resides in <module>.Application of some module root, the "
        + "shared kernel's included. Implementations are not selected; an empty "
        + "selection passes.")
