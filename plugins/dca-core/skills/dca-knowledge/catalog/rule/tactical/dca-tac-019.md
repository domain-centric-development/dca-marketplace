# Store interfaces must reside in the application layer (local to a use case or shared)

## Selection

Interfaces anywhere under scan assignable to Store, whatever their name, the marker Store itself excluded.

## Check

The interface resides in <module>.application.. of some module root, the shared kernel's included. Implementations are not selected; an empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Interfaces below the root namespace assignable to IStore, whatever their name; an interface named exactly Store excluded.

**Check.** The interface resides in <module>.Application of some module root, the shared kernel's included. Implementations are not selected; an empty selection passes.

## Rust reading

Unpublished (dca-rust); the suite implements it. **Held by** a lint or a test (source-test).

**Selection.** Traits that carry the store role, the building block excluded.

**Check.** Each sits in an application crate.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-TAC-019",
        "Store interfaces must reside in the application layer (local to a use case or shared)",
        "Store interfaces are output ports in the application layer (Hexagonal Architecture)",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .areInterfaces()
                .and(arch.layout().markers().is("store"))
                .and()
                .doNotHaveSimpleName(arch.layout().storeSuffix())
                .should(LayerConditions.be(arch.inApplication()))
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Interfaces anywhere under scan assignable to Store, whatever their name, the "
            + "marker Store itself excluded.")
    .checking(
        "The interface resides in <module>.application.. of some module root, "
            + "the shared kernel's included. Implementations are not selected; an empty "
            + "selection passes.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `inApplication()`, `layout()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
### C# expression

```csharp
DcaRule.Of(
    "DCA-TAC-019",
    "Store interfaces must reside in the application layer (local to a use case or shared)",
    "Store interfaces are output ports in the application layer (Hexagonal Architecture)",
    arch => NamespaceRule(arch, StoreInterfaces, arch.InApplication, "store interfaces should reside in an application namespace of their module"))
    .Selecting(
        "Interfaces below the root namespace assignable to IStore, whatever their "
        + "name; an interface named exactly Store excluded.")
    .Checking(
        "The interface resides in <module>.Application of some module root, the "
        + "shared kernel's included. Implementations are not selected; an empty "
        + "selection passes.")
```
