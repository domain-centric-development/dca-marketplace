## Selection

Non-interface, non-record classes in <module>.domain.model.. of every module root that are assignable to Value; enums included.

## Check

The class carries the final modifier. Records and interfaces are not selected, so a record value object always passes; a value object outside <module>.domain.model.. is never reported, and an empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Classes - record classes included, structs and enums not - in <module>.Domain.Model of every module root that are assignable to IValue; compiler-generated classes excluded.

**Check.** The class is sealed or abstract. A non-sealed record class is reported like a non-sealed class; structs and enums are never selected and so always pass, as does a value object outside <module>.Domain.Model. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-TAC-009",
        "Value Object classes should be final (immutability)",
        "Value objects should be immutable (final classes) - Vernon's DDD recommendation",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allDomainModelPatterns())
                .and()
                .implement(Value.class)
                .and()
                .areNotInterfaces()
                .and()
                .areNotRecords()
                .should()
                .haveModifier(JavaModifier.FINAL)
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface, non-record classes in <module>.domain.model.. of every module "
            + "root that are assignable to Value; enums included.")
    .checking(
        "The class carries the final modifier. Records and interfaces are not selected, "
            + "so a record value object always passes; a value object outside "
            + "<module>.domain.model.. is never reported, and an empty selection passes.")
```
