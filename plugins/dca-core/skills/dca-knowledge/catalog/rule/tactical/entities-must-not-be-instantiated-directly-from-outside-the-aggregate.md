```groovy
when:
// Entities (except Aggregate Roots) should not have public constructors
// They should only be created through their aggregate root
// This enforces aggregate boundaries and ensures invariants

def entityClasses = allClasses.stream()
  .filter { it.isAssignableTo(Entity.class) }
  .filter { !it.isAssignableTo(AggregateRoot.class) }  // Exclude aggregate roots
  .filter { !it.isInterface() }
  .filter { !it.isRecord() }  // Records always have public constructors
  .collect()

def violations = []
entityClasses.each { entityClass ->
  entityClass.getConstructors().each { constructor ->
    if (constructor.getModifiers().contains(JavaModifier.PUBLIC)) {
      violations.add("${entityClass.getName()} has public constructor - should be package-private or protected")
    }
  }
}

then:
if (!violations.isEmpty()) {
  throw new AssertionError(
  "Entities should not have public constructors (access only through aggregate root).\n" +
  "Note: Records are excluded from this rule.\n" +
  "Violations found:\n" + violations.join("\n"))
