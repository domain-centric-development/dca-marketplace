title: "Domain types must not hold bare primitives, strings or time types; a boolean only as a field or a predicate"
rule: "A value with rules of its own - a postal code, a quantity, a moment, an identifier - is a value object; held as a bare String, int, Instant or UUID its validation is repeated at every use or missing. A value object with several components holds value objects too; only a wrapper - a value of exactly one component - holds the primitive it wraps. A single yes/no fact may stay a boolean field: the type is told (complete()) and answers (isCompleted()). A boolean parameter is a flag argument - setCompleted(true) lets the caller set the state instead of triggering the behaviour - and three or more states, or transitions with rules, are an enum or a value."
constraint: "Domain types must not hold bare primitives, strings or time types; a boolean only as a field or a predicate."
selects: "Classes, records, enums and interfaces in <module>.domain.. of every module root, the shared kernel's domain included - their instance fields and their methods, private ones included; constructors are not selected, the fields they fill are. Not selected: a wrapper value - a type assignable to the value or the id role with exactly one instance field - with everything it declares; a type declared inside a value or an id, such as the value's own error shapes, which carry the input it refused; a failure - a type of the domain-exception or use-case-exception role; synthetic and bridge members; equals, hashCode, toString and compareTo; the values() and valueOf(String) the language declares on an enum; a method that implements a method of a building block, such as a domain event's occurredOn() or a specification's isSatisfiedBy, and the field of the same name behind it. A field whose type is boolean or Boolean - a single yes/no fact - and a boolean return - a question to the object, a predicate - pass; a boolean parameter and a public non-final boolean field, flag arguments, do not."
checks: "No selected field, return type or parameter type involves String, a primitive or its box, or a point in time (java.time.Instant, LocalDate, LocalDateTime, LocalTime, OffsetDateTime, ZonedDateTime, java.util.Date), nor a bare java.util.UUID - an identifier says whose it is through a typed id - generic type arguments included, so List<String> counts. BigDecimal, BigInteger, Duration and the project's own types pass. A field typed boolean or Boolean and a method returning one pass; a boolean among the parameters is a flag argument and counts, and so do a public non-final boolean field, which anyone may set, and a List<Boolean> field. A value object with several components is checked like any other type: each component is a value object itself. A record's accessor is not reported again beside its field. A reported type with exactly one instance field that is no value or id is told to carry the value or id role to count as a wrapper. An empty selection passes."

# Domain types must not hold bare primitives, strings or time types; a boolean only as a field or a predicate

**Experimental.** This rule is binding only in a project that opted in to experimental rules - the architecture test calls `withExperimental()` (.NET: `WithExperimental()`) on its rule selection, or `dca-archunit.properties` sets `dca.rules.experimental = true`; without that opt-in the rule does not run and is information only, never a finding and never a reason to change code.

## Selection

Classes, records, enums and interfaces in <module>.domain.. of every module root, the shared kernel's domain included - their instance fields and their methods, private ones included; constructors are not selected, the fields they fill are. Not selected: a wrapper value - a type assignable to the value or the id role with exactly one instance field - with everything it declares; a type declared inside a value or an id, such as the value's own error shapes, which carry the input it refused; a failure - a type of the domain-exception or use-case-exception role; synthetic and bridge members; equals, hashCode, toString and compareTo; the values() and valueOf(String) the language declares on an enum; a method that implements a method of a building block, such as a domain event's occurredOn() or a specification's isSatisfiedBy, and the field of the same name behind it. A field whose type is boolean or Boolean - a single yes/no fact - and a boolean return - a question to the object, a predicate - pass; a boolean parameter and a public non-final boolean field, flag arguments, do not.

## Check

No selected field, return type or parameter type involves String, a primitive or its box, or a point in time (java.time.Instant, LocalDate, LocalDateTime, LocalTime, OffsetDateTime, ZonedDateTime, java.util.Date), nor a bare java.util.UUID - an identifier says whose it is through a typed id - generic type arguments included, so List<String> counts. BigDecimal, BigInteger, Duration and the project's own types pass. A field typed boolean or Boolean and a method returning one pass; a boolean among the parameters is a flag argument and counts, and so do a public non-final boolean field, which anyone may set, and a List<Boolean> field. A value object with several components is checked like any other type: each component is a value object itself. A record's accessor is not reported again beside its field. A reported type with exactly one instance field that is no value or id is told to carry the value or id role to count as a wrapper. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Classes, records, structs, enums and interfaces in <Module>.Domain of every module root, the shared kernel's domain included, with their runtime type in the loaded assemblies - their declared instance fields and properties and their declared methods, private ones included; constructors are not selected, the members they fill are. Not selected: a wrapper value - a type assignable to IValue or IId with exactly one instance field - with everything it declares; a type declared inside a value or an id, such as the value's own error shapes, which carry the input it refused; a failure - a type of the domain-exception or use-case-exception role; compiler- generated members (a property's backing field, a record's EqualityContract, Deconstruct, PrintMembers); property accessors and operators; Equals, GetHashCode, ToString and CompareTo; an enum's members; a member that implements a building block's, such as a domain event's OccurredOn and EventId. A field typed bool or bool? - a single yes/no fact - and a bool return - a question to the object, a predicate - pass, and so does a bool property without a public setter (get-only, a private or init setter); a bool parameter, a bool property with a public setter and a public non-readonly bool field are flag arguments and do not.

**Check.** No selected field, property, return type or parameter type involves string, bool, a numeric primitive or char, a point in time (DateTime, DateTimeOffset, DateOnly, TimeOnly), or a bare Guid - an identifier says whose it is through a typed id - nullable and generic arguments and arrays included, so IReadOnlyList<string> counts. decimal, TimeSpan and the project's own types pass. A field or a property typed bool or bool? and a method returning one pass, unless anyone may set it - a public setter, a public non-readonly field; a bool among the parameters is a flag argument and counts, and so does an IReadOnlyList<bool>. A value object with several components is checked like any other type: each component is a value object itself. A reported type with exactly one instance field that is no value or id is told to carry the value or id role to count as a wrapper. An empty selection passes.

## Rust reading

Unpublished (dca-rust); the suite implements it. **Held by** a lint or a test (source-test).

**Selection.** Types, fields and pub signatures in every domain crate, the shared kernel's included. Not selected: a single-field newtype that implements Value or Id, failures, and trait methods of a building block.

**Check.** No field, parameter or return type, through generic arguments, is String, &str, a primitive, a time type (std::time::SystemTime, chrono, time) or a bare Uuid. A private field of type bool - a single yes/no fact - and a bool return - a predicate - pass; a bool parameter and a pub bool struct field, flag arguments, do not.

## Implementation

The verbatim ArchUnit expression is in the evidence slice [Overview](/evidence/rule/tactical/dca-tac-025/overview.md); every helper it calls has a slice of its own, listed under *Evidence slices* below.

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `classes()`, `inDomain()`, `layout()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
