# Entities must not be instantiated directly from outside the aggregate

## Selection

Constructor calls to non-root Entity types, records included.

## Check

The caller is the entity itself or an AggregateRoot, Entity or Factory in the same context domain layer. Same aggregate ownership is not decidable: another aggregate in that context passes and needs review. Reconstitution goes through an aggregate or factory; reflection is not inspected.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Constructor calls to non-root IEntity types, records and structs included.

**Check.** The caller is the entity itself or an IAggregateRoot, IEntity or IFactory in the same context domain layer. Same aggregate ownership is not decidable: another aggregate in that context passes and needs review. Reconstitution goes through an aggregate or factory; reflection is not inspected.

## Implementation

The verbatim ArchUnit expression is in the evidence slice [Overview](/evidence/rule/tactical/dca-tac-005/overview.md); every helper it calls has a slice of its own, listed under *Evidence slices* below.

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `classes()`, `layout()`, `moduleRootOf()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
