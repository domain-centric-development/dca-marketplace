## Selection

Non-interface, non-abstract classes anywhere under scan assignable to Entity - aggregate roots included, since AggregateRoot extends Entity.

## Check

At least one field - inherited ones included - has a raw type assignable to the Id marker. A String or UUID identity does not count, and the field's name plays no role.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-interface, non-abstract types below the root namespace assignable to IEntity - aggregate roots included, since IAggregateRoot extends IEntity.

**Check.** At least one field or property - inherited ones included, private fields of base classes seen through reflection - has a type assignable to the IId marker. A string or Guid identity does not count, and the member's name plays no role.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.check(
        "DCA-TAC-004",
        "Entities must have an ID field",
        "An Entity is defined by its identity, which is a value object implementing the Id marker",
        arch -> {
          List<String> violations = new ArrayList<>();
          for (JavaClass entity : concreteClassesAssignableTo(arch, Entity.class)) {
            if (entity.getModifiers().contains(JavaModifier.ABSTRACT)) {
              continue;
            }
            boolean hasIdField =
                entity.getAllFields().stream()
                    .anyMatch(f -> f.getRawType().isAssignableTo(Id.class));
            if (!hasIdField) {
              violations.add(
                  entity.getName()
                      + " has no field whose type implements "
                      + Id.class.getSimpleName());
            }
          }
          fail(
              "Entities must have an identity field typed as an Id value object (DDD pattern).",
              violations);
        })
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface, non-abstract classes anywhere under scan assignable to Entity - "
            + "aggregate roots included, since AggregateRoot extends Entity.")
    .checking(
        "At least one field - inherited ones included - has a raw type assignable to "
            + "the Id marker. A String or UUID identity does not count, and the field's name "
            + "plays no role.")
```

## Helpers

### `concreteClassesAssignableTo`

```java
private static List<JavaClass> concreteClassesAssignableTo(
    DcaArchitecture arch, Class<?> marker) {
  return classesMatching(arch, c -> c.isAssignableTo(marker) && !c.isInterface());
}
```

### `fail`

```java
private static void fail(String message, List<String> violations) {
  if (!violations.isEmpty()) {
    throw new DcaRuleViolation(message, violations);
  }
}
```

### `classesMatching`

```java
private static List<JavaClass> classesMatching(
    DcaArchitecture arch, Predicate<JavaClass> filter) {
  return arch.classes().stream().filter(filter).collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `classes()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).

## Applies to markers
