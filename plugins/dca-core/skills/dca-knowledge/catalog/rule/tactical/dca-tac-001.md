# Aggregate Roots must implement AggregateRoot<T, ID>

## Selection

Non-interface classes in <module>.domain.model.. of every module root whose simple name ends with AggregateRoot, the marker interface AggregateRoot itself excluded.

## Check

The class implements the AggregateRoot marker. Only the name suffix triggers selection - an aggregate root not named *AggregateRoot is never reported, and an empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-interface types - classes, structs and enums - in <module>.Domain.Model of every module root whose name ends with AggregateRoot; the type named exactly AggregateRoot is excluded.

**Check.** The type implements the IAggregateRoot marker. Only the name suffix triggers selection - an aggregate root not named *AggregateRoot is never reported, and an empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-TAC-001",
        "Aggregate Roots must implement AggregateRoot<T, ID>",
        "Classes named *AggregateRoot must implement AggregateRoot interface (DDD pattern)",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allDomainModelPatterns())
                .and()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith("AggregateRoot")
                .and()
                .areNotInterfaces()
                .and()
                .doNotHaveSimpleName("AggregateRoot")
                .should()
                .implement(AggregateRoot.class)
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface classes in <module>.domain.model.. of every module root whose "
            + "simple name ends with AggregateRoot, the marker interface AggregateRoot itself "
            + "excluded.")
    .checking(
        "The class implements the AggregateRoot marker. Only the name suffix triggers "
            + "selection - an aggregate root not named *AggregateRoot is never reported, and "
            + "an empty selection passes.")
```
