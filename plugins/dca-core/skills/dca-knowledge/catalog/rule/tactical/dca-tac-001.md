# Aggregate Roots must implement AggregateRoot<T, ID>

## Selection

Non-interface classes in <module>.domain.model.. of every module root whose simple name ends with AggregateRoot, the marker of the aggregate-root role itself excluded.

## Check

The class is assignable to the aggregate-root role - through the marker or an intermediate base class. Only the name suffix triggers selection - an aggregate root not named *AggregateRoot is never reported, and an empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-interface types - classes, structs and enums - in <module>.Domain.Model of every module root whose name ends with AggregateRoot; the type named exactly AggregateRoot is excluded.

**Check.** The type implements the IAggregateRoot marker. Only the name suffix triggers selection - an aggregate root not named *AggregateRoot is never reported, and an empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-TAC-001",
        "Aggregate Roots must implement AggregateRoot<T, ID>",
        "Classes named *AggregateRoot must implement AggregateRoot interface (DDD pattern)",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allDomainModelPatterns())
                .and()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith(layout.aggregateRootSuffix())
                .and()
                .areNotInterfaces()
                .and()
                .doNotHaveSimpleName(layout.aggregateRootSuffix())
                .should()
                .beAssignableTo(arch.layout().markers().aggregateRoot())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface classes in <module>.domain.model.. of every module root whose "
            + "simple name ends with AggregateRoot, the marker of the aggregate-root role "
            + "itself excluded.")
    .checking(
        "The class is assignable to the aggregate-root role - through the marker or an "
            + "intermediate base class. Only the name suffix triggers "
            + "selection - an aggregate root not named *AggregateRoot is never reported, and "
            + "an empty selection passes.")
```
