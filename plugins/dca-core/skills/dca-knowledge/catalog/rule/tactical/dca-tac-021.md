# Store interfaces must not declare save or delete methods

## Selection

Interfaces anywhere under scan assignable to Store, the marker Store itself excluded.

## Check

No method declared on the interface itself is named save, deleteById or delete - matched by name alone, parameters and return type disregarded. Inherited methods are not inspected, and no particular vocabulary (record, count, exists) is required.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Interfaces below the root namespace assignable to IStore; an interface named exactly Store excluded.

**Check.** No method declared on the interface itself is named SaveAsync, DeleteByIdAsync or DeleteAsync, nor their synchronous forms Save, DeleteById and Delete, nor the camel-cased save, deleteById and delete - matched by name alone, parameters and return type disregarded. Inherited methods are not inspected, and no particular vocabulary (Record, Count, Exists) is required.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.check(
        "DCA-TAC-021",
        "Store interfaces must not declare save or delete methods",
        "save/delete are Repository semantics; a Store that has them is a Repository wearing the"
            + " wrong name, and the stored object should then be an Aggregate Root",
        arch -> {
          List<String> violations = new ArrayList<>();
          for (JavaClass store : storeInterfaces(arch)) {
            for (JavaMethod method : store.getMethods()) {
              if (REPOSITORY_METHOD_NAMES.contains(method.getName())) {
                violations.add(
                    store.getFullName()
                        + "."
                        + method.getName()
                        + "() - Repository semantics on a Store");
              }
            }
          }
          fail(
              "Store interfaces use record/count/exists semantics, not save/delete."
                  + " Fix: rename to *Repository if the stored object is an Aggregate Root,"
                  + " otherwise rename the methods to record(...), count(...), exists(...).",
              violations);
        })
    .selecting(
        "Interfaces anywhere under scan assignable to Store, the marker Store itself "
            + "excluded.")
    .checking(
        "No method declared on the interface itself is named save, deleteById "
            + "or delete - matched by name alone, parameters and return type disregarded. "
            + "Inherited methods are not inspected, and no particular vocabulary (record, "
            + "count, exists) is required.")
```

## Helpers

### `storeInterfaces`

```java
private static List<JavaClass> storeInterfaces(DcaArchitecture arch) {
  return classesMatching(
      arch,
      c ->
          c.isAssignableTo(Store.class)
              && c.isInterface()
              && !c.getSimpleName().equals(STORE_SUFFIX));
}
```

### `fail`

```java
private static void fail(String message, List<String> violations) {
  if (!violations.isEmpty()) {
    throw new DcaRuleViolation(message, violations);
  }
}
```

### `classesMatching`

```java
private static List<JavaClass> classesMatching(
    DcaArchitecture arch, Predicate<JavaClass> filter) {
  return arch.classes().stream().filter(filter).collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `classes()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
### C# expression

```csharp
DcaRule.Check(
    "DCA-TAC-021",
    "Store interfaces must not declare Save or Delete methods",
    "Save/Delete are Repository semantics; a Store that has them is a Repository wearing the"
    + " wrong name, and the stored object should then be an Aggregate Root",
    arch =>

                if (RepositoryMethodNames.Contains(methodName))
                {
                    violations.Add($"{store.FullName}.{methodName}() - Repository semantics on a Store");
                }
            }
        }

        DcaRule.Fail(
            "Store interfaces use Record/Count/Exists semantics, not Save/Delete.",
            violations,
            "rename to *Repository if the stored object is an Aggregate Root, otherwise rename the methods to RecordAsync(...), CountAsync(...), ExistsAsync(...).");
