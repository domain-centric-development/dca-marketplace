title: Declaratively transactional use cases must not call remote-capable output ports
rule: "A @Transactional use case holds a database connection for its whole run. Calling an output port that may leave the process (another context's API, a payment provider, a mail gateway) inside it blocks that connection for the remote round trip; under load the pool runs dry, and a rollback cannot undo the remote effect. Only transactional resources belong inside the boundary: Repository, Store, DomainEventPublisher, IntegrationEventPublisher. Everything else is called before the transaction - draw the boundary by hand with TransactionBoundary.inTransaction(...) - or after it, as a reaction to an integration event."

not_applicable_dotnet: "Guards against remote-capable output ports called inside a @Transactional use case. .NET has no declarative transaction metadata on use cases — the boundary is a decorator or an explicit ITransactionBoundary.InTransactionAsync — so the rule has nothing to anchor on; DCA-NET-006 keeps transaction and persistence frameworks out of the application layer instead"
