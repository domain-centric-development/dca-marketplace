# Use cases that publish domain events must have a transaction boundary

## Selection

Non-interface classes in <module>.application.. that implement InputPort or whose simple name ends with the configured use-case suffix.

## Check

For every method that calls a DomainEventPublisher, every route from each entry point down to it is covered: the class carries one of the configured transactional annotations, or every uncovered unit on the route is either annotated or calls TransactionBoundary.inTransaction. A covered caller does not cover a second route to the same helper. With an empty transactional role only the explicit boundary counts. Whether the publish call sits inside the inTransaction block is not checked - ArchUnit folds a lambda into its enclosing method.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Concrete application operations selected by IInputPort marker or suffix with loadable runtime types, including closure and async units.

**Check.** Every entry path to an IDomainEventPublisher call crosses a unit calling ITransactionBoundary.InTransactionAsync (including its extension overloads) or carrying the configured TransactionalAttribute; a type-level attribute covers all paths. Static limit: a boundary call in the same unit passes even when publication follows an empty boundary block. Runtime rollback containment must be tested separately.
