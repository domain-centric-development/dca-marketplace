title: Use cases that publish domain events must run inside a transaction boundary
rule: "Integration events are relayed after commit (@TransactionalEventListener, @ApplicationModuleListener) and their publication is registered in the publishing transaction. Without an active transaction the after-commit listeners are skipped silently and nothing is registered: the use case succeeds, the other contexts never hear of it. The use case that publishes owns the boundary - @Transactional on the class or the executing method, or an explicit UnitOfWork.run(...) around save and publish."
constraint: Use cases that publish domain events must run inside a transaction boundary.

not_applicable_dotnet: "Guards Spring's after-commit relay (@TransactionalEventListener / @ApplicationModuleListener), which is skipped silently without an active transaction. .NET has no ambient transaction attribute on use cases; after-save delivery is the job of the integration-event outbox adapter, not of the use case"
