# Use cases that save an aggregate must publish its domain events

## Selection

Non-interface classes in <module>.application.. that implement InputPort or whose simple name ends with the configured use-case suffix.

## Check

Only a resolved Repository<T,ID> whose aggregate and every non-building-block superclass are scanned and have no registration call (including helpers) is exempt. Unresolved generics, partial scans or undecidable external helpers remain required. For every non-exempt method of the class that calls Repository.save, every entry point reaching it (a method callable from outside the class, or one nothing in the class calls) also reaches, through calls within the class, a call of DomainEventPublisher.publishAndClearEvents. Only publishAndClearEvents counts - publish(event), even followed by clearDomainEvents(), does not. A use case without a save (a query, a bulk delete) is selected but has nothing to check and passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Classes in <module>.Application of every module root selected by IInputPort assignability or the configured use-case suffix, whose runtime type is in the loaded assemblies.

**Check.** Only a resolved IRepository<T,ID> aggregate with its complete non-building-block hierarchy under scan and no registration call, including helpers, is exempt. Unresolved arguments, partial scans and undecidable external helpers are not exempt. For every non-exempt method calling IRepository.SaveAsync, every entry point reaching it (a method callable from outside the class, or one nothing in the class calls) also reaches, through calls within the class, a call of IDomainEventPublisher.PublishAndClearEventsAsync. Calls are read from the IL of the class and its nested state-machine and closure types, so async methods and lambdas are followed. Only PublishAndClearEventsAsync counts - PublishAsync(event), even followed by ClearDomainEvents(), does not. A use case without a save (a query, a bulk delete) is selected but has nothing to check and passes.
