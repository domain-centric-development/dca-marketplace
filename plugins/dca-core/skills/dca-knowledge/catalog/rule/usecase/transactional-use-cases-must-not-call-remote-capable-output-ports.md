title: Transactional use cases must not call remote-capable output ports
rule: "A @Transactional use case holds a database connection for its whole run. Calling an output port that may leave the process (another context's API, a payment provider, a mail gateway) inside it blocks that connection for the remote round trip; under load the pool runs dry, and a rollback cannot undo the remote effect. Only transactional resources belong inside the boundary: Repository, Store, DomainEventPublisher, IntegrationEventPublisher. Everything else is called before the transaction - draw the boundary by hand with UnitOfWork.run(...) - or after it, as a reaction to an integration event."

not_applicable_dotnet: "Guards against remote-capable output ports called inside a @Transactional use case. .NET marks no use case as transactional — the boundary is a decorator or an explicit IUnitOfWork.RunAsync — so the rule has nothing to anchor on; DCA-NET-006 keeps transaction and persistence frameworks out of the application layer instead"
