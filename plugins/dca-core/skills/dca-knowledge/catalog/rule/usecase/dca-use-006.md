# Use Case Result Models must end with 'Result' and reside in application package

## Selection

Classes under the base package whose simple name ends with Result and that do not implement Value.

## Check

Each resides in an application package of some module root (<module>.application..). A domain value object named *Result is exempt because it implements Value.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types under the root namespace whose name ends with Result and that do not implement IValue.

**Check.** Each resides in an application namespace of some module root (<module>.Application). A domain value object named *Result is exempt because it implements IValue.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-USE-006",
        "Use Case Result Models must end with 'Result' and reside in application package",
        "Use case result models should be in application layer. Domain Value Objects with 'Result'"
            + " in name are allowed in domain layer.",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith("Result")
                .and()
                .resideInAnyPackage(layout.basePackage() + "..")
                .and()
                .doNotImplement(Value.class)
                .should()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allApplicationPatterns())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Classes under the base package whose simple name ends with Result and that do not implement Value.")
    .checking(
        "Each resides in an application package of some module root (<module>.application..). A domain value object named *Result is exempt because it implements Value.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allApplicationPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
