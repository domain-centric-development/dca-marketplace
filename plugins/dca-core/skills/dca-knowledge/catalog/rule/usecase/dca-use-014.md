The rule checks legibility only: it does not infer bounded contexts, feature semantics or aggregate ownership. application.shared holds the context-wide output ports and is not a use case package."

# Use case packages within a module must use one consistent depth (flat or grouped by feature)

## Selection

Per module root: non-interface, non-abstract, non-nested classes below <module>.application that implement InputPort or whose simple name ends with the configured use-case suffix, excluding application.shared and everything below it.

## Check

After removing configured operationContainers segments, all of them sit at one depth: application.<usecase> (flat) or application.<feature>.<usecase> (grouped). Reported are a use case directly in the application package, one nested deeper than a feature, and a module mixing both depths. What a feature means is not checked.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Per module root: non-abstract, non-nested classes below <module>.Application that implement IInputPort or whose name ends with the configured use-case suffix, excluding Application.Shared and everything below it.

**Check.** After removing configured OperationContainers segments, all of them sit at one depth: Application.<UseCase> (flat) or Application.<Feature>.<UseCase> (grouped). Reported are a use case directly in the application namespace, one nested deeper than a feature, and a module mixing both depths. What a feature means is not checked.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.check(
        "DCA-USE-014",
        "Use case packages within a module must use one consistent depth (flat or grouped by"
            + " feature)",
        "A use case package sits either directly below the application package"
            + " (application.<usecase>) or one level deeper inside a feature"
            + " (application.<feature>.<usecase>). A feature is an optional, domain-named group of"
            + " related use cases - a navigation boundary inside one bounded context, not a layer,"
            + " module or aggregate owner. Mixing both forms in one module makes it unclear whether"
            + " a package is a feature, a use case or a leftover; nesting deeper than a feature hides"
            + " the use case. The rule checks legibility only: it does not infer bounded contexts,"
            + " feature semantics or aggregate ownership. application.shared holds the context-wide"
            + " output ports and is not a use case package",
        arch -> checkUseCaseDepth(arch, layout))
    .selecting(
        "Per module root: non-interface, non-abstract, non-nested classes below <module>.application that implement InputPort or whose simple name ends with the configured use-case suffix, excluding application.shared and everything below it.")
    .checking(
        "After removing configured operationContainers segments, all of them sit at one depth: application.<usecase> (flat) or application.<feature>.<usecase> (grouped). Reported are a use case directly in the application package, one nested deeper than a feature, and a module mixing both depths. What a feature means is not checked.")

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `classes()`, `moduleRoots()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
