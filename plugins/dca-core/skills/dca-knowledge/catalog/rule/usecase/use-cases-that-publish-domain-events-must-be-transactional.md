title: Use cases that publish domain events must be transactional
rule: "Integration events are relayed after commit (@TransactionalEventListener, @ApplicationModuleListener) and their publication is registered in the publishing transaction. Without an active transaction the after-commit listeners are skipped silently and nothing is registered: the use case succeeds, the other contexts never hear of it. The use case that publishes owns the transaction - on the class or on the executing method."

status: enforced
rule_set: usecase
implementations: [java]
tags: [usecase, archunit]
not_applicable_dotnet: "Guards Spring's after-commit relay (@TransactionalEventListener / @ApplicationModuleListener), which is skipped silently without an active transaction. .NET has no ambient transaction attribute on use cases; after-save delivery is the job of the integration-event outbox adapter, not of the use case"
