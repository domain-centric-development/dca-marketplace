title: Use Case Result Models must not expose aggregate roots or entities
rule: "A result is the use case's answer, not a handle on the model: identity and behaviour stay behind the port; values, enriched models and read models may cross. Checked transitively through nested records, part records anywhere in the application layer (application.shared included), generic type arguments (List<T>, Optional<T>, Map<K,V>) and inherited fields, a generic base class's type parameters resolved as the result binds them."
