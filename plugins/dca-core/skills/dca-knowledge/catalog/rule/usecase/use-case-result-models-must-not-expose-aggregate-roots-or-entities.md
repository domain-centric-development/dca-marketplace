## Selection

Non-interface, non-nested classes in <module>.application.. whose simple name ends with Result.

## Check

No instance field - inherited ones included, walked through raw type and generic type arguments, and transitively into every record that lives in an application package - involves a type assignable to AggregateRoot or Entity. Records outside the application layer (domain value objects, read models) are not walked. Every offending path is reported.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-nested classes in <module>.Application of every module root whose name ends with Result and that are not assignable to IValue; the runtime type must be in the loaded assemblies.

**Check.** No instance property or field of any visibility - inherited ones included, walked through array element types and generic type arguments (IReadOnlyList<T>, T?, IReadOnlyDictionary<K,V>), and transitively into every record that lives in an application namespace - has a type assignable to IAggregateRoot or IEntity. Records outside the application layer (domain value objects, read models) are not walked. Every offending path is reported.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.check(
        "DCA-USE-015",
        "Use Case Result Models must not expose aggregate roots or entities",
        "A result is the use case's answer, not a handle on the model: identity and behaviour stay"
            + " behind the port; values, enriched models and read models may cross. Checked"
            + " transitively through nested records, part records anywhere in the application layer"
            + " (application.shared included), generic type arguments (List<T>, Optional<T>,"
            + " Map<K,V>) and inherited fields, a generic base class's type parameters resolved as"
            + " the result binds them",
        arch -> checkResultsCarryNoIdentities(arch))
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface, non-nested classes in <module>.application.. whose simple name ends with Result.")
    .checking(
        "No instance field - inherited ones included, walked through raw type and generic type arguments, and transitively into every record that lives in an application package - involves a type assignable to AggregateRoot or Entity. Records outside the application layer (domain value objects, read models) are not walked. Every offending path is reported.")

## Helpers

### `checkResultsCarryNoIdentities`

```java
private static void checkResultsCarryNoIdentities(DcaArchitecture arch) {
  List<String> violations = new ArrayList<>();
  for (JavaClass result : arch.classes()) {
    if (result.isInterface()
        || result.isNestedClass()

        || !residesInAny(result, arch.allApplicationPatterns())) {
      continue;
    }
    walkResult(
        arch.allApplicationPatterns(),
        result,
        result.getSimpleName(),

  }
  if (!violations.isEmpty()) {
    throw new DcaRuleViolation(
        "Use Case Result Models must not expose aggregate roots or entities", violations);
  }
}
```

### `residesInAny`

```java
private static boolean residesInAny(JavaClass javaClass, String[] packagePatterns) {

    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

### `walkResult`

```java
/**
   * Walks the instance fields of a result or part record — inherited ones included, a base class
   * need not carry the suffix, and a generic base's type parameters are read as the result binds
   * them — and every type each field involves. The path of records currently being walked guards
   * against a self-referencing part record; it is not a global visited set, so the same part record
   * reached through two fields is reported on both paths.
   */
  private static void walkResult(
      String[] applicationPatterns,

        }

### `identityKind`

```java
/** The marker a class carries into the result, or null when it is a value or plain type. */

    }
    return null;
  }
```

### `isPartRecord`

```java
/**
   * A part record: a record that lives in an application package - nested in the result, declared
   * next to it, or shared in {@code application.shared}. Records from other layers (value objects,
   * read models) are values by contract and are not walked.
   */

### `TypeInspection.instanceFields`

   * stable across runs. Static fields — constants, counters — are not part of an object's state.

### `TypeInspection.involvedTypes`
