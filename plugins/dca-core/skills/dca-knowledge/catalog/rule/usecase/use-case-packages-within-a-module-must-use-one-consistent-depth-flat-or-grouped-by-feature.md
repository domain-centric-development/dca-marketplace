title: "Use case packages within a module must use one consistent depth (flat or grouped by feature)"
rule: "A use case package sits either directly below the application package (application.<usecase>) or one level deeper inside a feature (application.<feature>.<usecase>). A feature is an optional, domain-named group of related use cases - a navigation boundary inside one bounded context, not a layer, module or aggregate owner. Mixing both forms in one module makes it unclear whether a package is a feature, a use case or a leftover; nesting deeper than a feature hides the use case. The rule checks legibility only: it does not infer bounded contexts, feature semantics or aggregate ownership. application.shared holds the context-wide output ports and is not a use case package."
