# The base InputPort contract is not redeclared in the project

## Selection

Interfaces named InputPort or IInputPort anywhere on the classpath under scan - both spellings, so the rule means the same in both languages - except the type the inputPort role names.

## Check

The interface resides in the building-blocks package hexagonal.port.in or in the package of the configured inputPort role - the generic contract is declared once, by the vocabulary in use, and not redeclared elsewhere in the project.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Interfaces named InputPort or IInputPort anywhere in the loaded assemblies - except the type the InputPort role names.

**Check.** The interface resides in the building-blocks namespace Hexagonal.Ports.In or in the namespace of the configured InputPort role - the generic contract is declared once, by the vocabulary in use, and not redeclared elsewhere in the project.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-USE-001",
        "The base InputPort contract is not redeclared in the project",
        "Base InputPort interface defines the generic contract for all use cases (Hexagonal"
            + " Architecture)",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .areInterfaces()
                .and(
                    JavaClass.Predicates.simpleName("InputPort")
                        .or(JavaClass.Predicates.simpleName("IInputPort")))
                .and()
                .doNotHaveFullyQualifiedName(arch.layout().markers().inputPort())
                .should()
                .resideInAnyPackage(
                    Stream.concat(
                            Stream.of(DcaLayout.BUILDING_BLOCKS_PORT_IN_PACKAGE),
                            arch
                                .layout()
                                .markers()
                                .declaringPackagePatternsOf(List.of("inputPort"))
                                .stream())
                        .distinct()
                        .toArray(String[]::new))
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Interfaces named InputPort or IInputPort anywhere on the classpath under scan - both"
            + " spellings, so the rule means the same in both languages - except the type the"
            + " inputPort role names.")
    .checking(
        "The interface resides in the building-blocks package hexagonal.port.in or in the"
            + " package of the configured inputPort role - the generic contract is declared"
            + " once, by the vocabulary in use, and not redeclared elsewhere in the project.")
```
