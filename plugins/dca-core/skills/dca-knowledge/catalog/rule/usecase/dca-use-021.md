# Use cases should be stateless (only final fields for dependencies)

**Experimental.** This rule is binding only in a project that opted in to experimental rules - the architecture test calls `withExperimental()` (.NET: `WithExperimental()`) on its rule selection, or `dca-archunit.properties` sets `dca.rules.experimental = true`; without that opt-in the rule does not run and is information only, never a finding and never a reason to change code.

## Selection

Non-interface classes in <module>.application.. that implement InputPort or whose simple name ends with the configured use-case suffix.

## Check

Every instance field - declared or inherited from a superclass - is final. Static fields are not an instance's state and are not inspected; field types are not inspected either, so a final field holding mutable state passes. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Concrete non-nested application operations selected by IInputPort marker or configured use-case suffix, with loadable runtime types - the use cases DCA-USE-019 selects, whatever their input.

**Check.** Every instance field - declared by the class or inherited from a base class - is readonly or const, and no auto-property has a setter: its backing field is read like any field, so a get-only or init-only property passes. A parameter of a primary constructor that the class captures is held in a compiler-generated field the language cannot make readonly; it is reported only when a method other than a constructor assigns it. Static fields and the types of the fields are not inspected, so a readonly field holding mutable state passes. An empty selection passes.

## Rust reading

Unpublished (dca-rust); planned, not yet implemented. **Held by** a lint or a test (source-test).

**Selection.** Types that implement an input port (a trait extending UseCase).

**Check.** No method of their impls takes &mut self, and no field holds interior mutability (Cell, RefCell, Mutex, RwLock, an atomic). Planned: the suite does not implement it yet.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-USE-021",
        "Use cases should be stateless (only final fields for dependencies)",
        "One instance of a use case serves every caller. A field it writes while it runs is"
            + " shared by the next call and by concurrent ones, and one call's outcome depends"
            + " on the call before. What a use case holds is set once, by its constructor: the"
            + " ports and services it is wired with",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that(useCases(arch, layout))
                .should(haveOnlyFinalInstanceFields())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .experimental()
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface classes in <module>.application.. that implement InputPort or whose"
            + " simple name ends with the configured use-case suffix.")
    .checking(
        "Every instance field - declared or inherited from a superclass - is final. Static"
            + " fields are not an instance's state and are not inspected; field types are not"
            + " inspected either, so a final field holding mutable state passes. An empty"
            + " selection passes.",
        "pass what a call needs through the command or keep it in a local; the constructor"
            + " sets only the collaborators")
```

## Helpers

### `useCases`

```java
/**
   * The documented use-case selection: a non-interface class in an application package that either
   * carries the configured use-case suffix or implements the input-port role.
   *
   * <p>Spelled inline, ArchUnit joins {@code and}/{@code or} left to right, so {@code
   * resideInAnyPackage(app).and().haveSimpleNameEndingWith(suffix).or().areAssignableTo(port)
   * .and().areNotInterfaces()} reads {@code ((inApplication ∧ suffix) ∨ isInputPort) ∧ ¬interface}
   * and selects every input-port implementation anywhere, adapters included — which is neither what
   * the rule texts say nor what the .NET twin does.
   */
  private static DescribedPredicate<JavaClass> useCases(DcaArchitecture arch, DcaLayout layout) {
    DescribedPredicate<JavaClass> inApplication = arch.inApplication();
    DescribedPredicate<JavaClass> named =
        JavaClass.Predicates.simpleNameEndingWith(layout.useCaseSuffix());
    DescribedPredicate<JavaClass> port = arch.layout().markers().is("inputPort");
    return inApplication
        .and(named.or(port))
        .and(DescribedPredicate.not(JavaClass.Predicates.INTERFACES))
        .as(
            "non-interface classes in an application package that implement the input port or end"
                + " with \"%s\"",
            layout.useCaseSuffix());
  }
```

### `haveOnlyFinalInstanceFields`

```java
private static ArchCondition<JavaClass> haveOnlyFinalInstanceFields() {
  return new ArchCondition<>("have only final instance fields, inherited ones included") {
    @Override
    public void check(JavaClass item, ConditionEvents events) {
      for (JavaField field : TypeInspection.instanceFields(item)) {
        if (field.getModifiers().contains(JavaModifier.FINAL)
            || field.getModifiers().contains(JavaModifier.SYNTHETIC)) {
          continue;
        }
        events.add(
            SimpleConditionEvent.violated(
                item,
                item.getName()
                    + " has the non-final field '"
                    + field.getName()
                    + "'"
                    + (field.getOwner().equals(item)
                        ? ""
                        : " inherited from " + field.getOwner().getSimpleName())));
      }
    }
  };
}
```

### `TypeInspection.instanceFields`

```java
/**
   * The instance fields of a class, inherited ones included, sorted by name so that reports are
   * stable across runs. Static fields — constants, counters — are not part of an object's state.
   */
  static List<JavaField> instanceFields(JavaClass type) {
    return type.getAllFields().stream()
        .filter(field -> !field.getModifiers().contains(JavaModifier.STATIC))
        .sorted(Comparator.comparing(JavaField::getName))
        .toList();
  }
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `inApplication()`, `layout()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
