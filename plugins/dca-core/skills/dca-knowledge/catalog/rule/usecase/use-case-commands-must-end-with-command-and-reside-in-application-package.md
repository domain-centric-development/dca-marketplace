## Selection

Classes under the base package whose simple name ends with Command.

## Check

Each resides in an application package of some module root (<module>.application..). A Command in a domain, adapter or infrastructure package is reported.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types under the root namespace whose name ends with Command.

**Check.** Each resides in an application namespace of some module root (<module>.Application). A Command in a domain, adapter or infrastructure namespace is reported.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-USE-002",
        "Use Case Commands must end with 'Command' and reside in application package",
        "Use case commands should be in application layer (CQRS pattern)",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith("Command")
                .and()
                .resideInAnyPackage(layout.basePackage() + "..")
                .should()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allApplicationPatterns())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting("Classes under the base package whose simple name ends with Command.")
    .checking(
        "Each resides in an application package of some module root (<module>.application..). A Command in a domain, adapter or infrastructure package is reported.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allApplicationPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
