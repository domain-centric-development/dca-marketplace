# Commands reside in the application layer

## Selection

Classes under the base package the configured command role recognises - by default a simple name ending with Command.

## Check

Each resides in an application package of some module root (<module>.application..). A Command in a domain, adapter or infrastructure package is reported.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types under the root namespace the configured command role recognises - by default a simple name ending with Command.

**Check.** Each resides in an application namespace of some module root (<module>.Application). A Command in a domain, adapter or infrastructure namespace is reported.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-USE-002",
        "Commands reside in the application layer",
        "Use case commands should be in application layer (CQRS pattern)",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that(arch.layout().markers().is("command"))
                .and()
                .resideInAnyPackage(layout.basePackage() + "..")
                .should(LayerConditions.be(arch.inApplication()))
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Classes under the base package the configured command role recognises - by default a"
            + " simple name ending with Command.")
    .checking(
        "Each resides in an application package of some module root (<module>.application..). A Command in a domain, adapter or infrastructure package is reported.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `inApplication()`, `layout()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
