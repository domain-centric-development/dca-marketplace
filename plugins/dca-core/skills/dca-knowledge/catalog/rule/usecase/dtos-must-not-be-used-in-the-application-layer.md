## Selection

Classes in <module>.application.. of every module root.

## Check

No dependency on a class whose simple name ends with Dto. Command, Query and Result models are not DTOs by this rule's definition - only the Dto suffix is checked.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types in <module>.Application of every module root.

**Check.** No dependency on a type whose name ends with Dto. Command, Query and Result models are not DTOs by this rule's definition - only the Dto suffix is checked.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-USE-011",
        "DTOs must not be used in the Application Layer",
        "Application layer should use Command/Query/Response models, not presentation DTOs (Clean"
            + " Architecture)",
        arch ->
            noClasses()
                .that()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allApplicationPatterns())
                .should()
                .dependOnClassesThat()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith("Dto")
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting("Classes in <module>.application.. of every module root.")
    .checking(
        "No dependency on a class whose simple name ends with Dto. Command, Query and Result models are not DTOs by this rule's definition - only the Dto suffix is checked.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allApplicationPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
