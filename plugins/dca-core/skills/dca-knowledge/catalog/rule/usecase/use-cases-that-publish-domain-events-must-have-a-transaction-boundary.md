title: Use cases that publish domain events must have a transaction boundary
rule: "Integration events are relayed after commit (@TransactionalEventListener, @ApplicationModuleListener) and their publication is registered in the publishing transaction. Without an active transaction the after-commit listeners are skipped silently and nothing is registered: the use case succeeds, the other contexts never hear of it. The use case that publishes owns the boundary - either declarative transaction metadata (@Transactional on the class or the executing method) or an explicit TransactionBoundary.inTransaction(...) around save and publish. Checked per entry path, following calls within the class: from every entry point - a method callable from outside the class, or one nothing in the class calls - no route down to the publishing method may be free of an annotation or a boundary; a covered caller does not cover another route to the same helper, and a boundary on one route does not cover a second route. Whether the publication sits inside the block handed to inTransaction(...) is not visible in ArchUnit's call model, which folds a lambda's body into the enclosing method; that placement stays a review check."
