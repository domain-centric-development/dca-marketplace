title: Use cases that publish domain events must have a transaction boundary
rule: "Integration events are relayed after commit (@TransactionalEventListener, @ApplicationModuleListener) and their publication is registered in the publishing transaction. Without an active transaction the after-commit listeners are skipped silently and nothing is registered: the use case succeeds, the other contexts never hear of it. The use case that publishes owns the boundary - either declarative transaction metadata (@Transactional on the class or the executing method) or an explicit TransactionBoundary.inTransaction(...) around save and publish. Checked per entry path, following calls within the class: from every entry point - a method callable from outside the class, or one nothing in the class calls - no route down to the publishing method may be free of an annotation or a boundary; a covered caller does not cover another route to the same helper, and a boundary on one route does not cover a second route. Whether the publication sits inside the block handed to inTransaction(...) is not visible in ArchUnit's call model, which folds a lambda's body into the enclosing method; that placement stays a review check."
constraint: Use cases that publish domain events must have a transaction boundary.

## Selection

Non-interface classes in <module>.application.. whose simple name ends with the configured use-case suffix.

## Check

For every method that calls a DomainEventPublisher, every route from each entry point down to it is covered: the class carries the configured @Transactional, or every uncovered unit on the route is either annotated or calls TransactionBoundary.inTransaction. A covered caller does not cover a second route to the same helper. Whether the publish call sits inside the inTransaction block is not checked - ArchUnit folds a lambda into its enclosing method.

## Implementation

        }
      }
    }
  };
}
```

### `calls`

```java
private static boolean calls(JavaCodeUnit unit, Class<?> targetType) {
  return unit.getMethodCallsFromSelf().stream()
      .anyMatch(call -> call.getTargetOwner().isAssignableTo(targetType));
}

private static boolean calls(JavaCodeUnit unit, Class<?> targetType, String methodName) {

### `pathIsTransactional`

```java
/**
   * Whether every route from {@code entry} down to {@code publisher} is covered: the class is
   * annotated, or no route reaches the publisher through units none of which carries the annotation
   * or draws an explicit boundary. A boundary on one route does not cover another route to the same
   * publisher.
   */
  private static boolean pathIsTransactional(
      JavaClass item,
      JavaCodeUnit entry,
      JavaCodeUnit publisher,
      IntraClassCalls calls,

```

### `IntraClassCalls.entryPointsOf`

```java

   * The paths a unit can be entered on: those of its (transitive) callers - the unit itself
   * included - that are entry points. A unit is an entry point when it can be called from outside
   * the class (any code unit that is not private, synthetic or a bridge - a public method stays an
   * entry point even when another method of the class also calls it) or when no unit of the class
   * calls it. When the unit is reached only from within a cycle of private helpers, so that no
   * caller qualifies, the unit itself is taken as the entry point.

### `IntraClassCalls.reachableThrough`

```java
/**
   * The units reachable from {@code start} on routes that pass only through units satisfying {@code
   * through} - {@code start} included, and only if it satisfies it too. A unit that fails the
   * predicate is not entered, so nothing behind it is reached on that route (it may still be
   * reached on another). Cycle-safe.
