# InputPort interfaces must end with 'InputPort'

## Selection

Interfaces in <module>.application.. of every module root that are assignable to InputPort, except those named exactly InputPort or UseCase.

## Check

The simple name ends with InputPort. Classes and records are not selected, and an interface extending InputPort outside an application package is not checked. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Interfaces in <module>.Application of every module root that are assignable to IInputPort, except those named exactly InputPort, IInputPort, UseCase or IUseCase.

**Check.** The name starts with I and ends with InputPort (IPlaceOrderInputPort). Classes and records are not selected, and an interface extending IInputPort outside an application namespace is not checked. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-NAM-003",
        "InputPort interfaces must end with 'InputPort'",
        "Input port interfaces should follow consistent naming conventions (Hexagonal Architecture)",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allApplicationPatterns())
                .and()
                .areInterfaces()
                .and()
                .areAssignableTo(InputPort.class)
                .and()
                .doNotHaveSimpleName("InputPort")
                .and()
                .doNotHaveSimpleName("UseCase")
                .should()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith("InputPort")
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Interfaces in <module>.application.. of every module root that are assignable to"
            + " InputPort, except those named exactly InputPort or UseCase.")
    .checking(
        "The simple name ends with InputPort. Classes and records are not selected, and an"
            + " interface extending InputPort outside an application package is not checked. An"
            + " empty selection passes.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allApplicationPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
### C# expression

```csharp
DcaRule.Check(
        "DCA-NAM-003",
        "InputPort interfaces must end with 'InputPort'",
        "Input port interfaces should follow consistent naming conventions (Hexagonal Architecture)",
        arch =>
        {
            var violations = arch.Interfaces
                .Where(i => InNamespace(i, DcaLayout.AnyOf(arch.AllApplicationPatterns()))
                    && IsAssignableTo(arch, i, typeof(IInputPort))
                    && !IsBaseInputPortName(i.Name)
                    && !(i.Name.StartsWith("I", StringComparison.Ordinal) && i.Name.EndsWith("InputPort", StringComparison.Ordinal)))
                .Select(i => $"{i.FullName} is an input port but is not named I*InputPort")
                .ToList();
            DcaRule.Fail(
                "InputPort interfaces must end with 'InputPort'",
                violations,
                "rename the interface to I<UseCaseName>InputPort");
        })
    .Selecting(
        "Interfaces in <module>.Application of every module root that are assignable to"
            + " IInputPort, except those named exactly InputPort, IInputPort, UseCase or IUseCase.")
    .Checking(
        "The name starts with I and ends with InputPort (IPlaceOrderInputPort). Classes and"
            + " records are not selected, and an interface extending IInputPort outside an"
            + " application namespace is not checked. An empty selection passes.")
