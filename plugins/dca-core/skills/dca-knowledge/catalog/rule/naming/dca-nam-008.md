# Converters must reside in the adapter layer

## Selection

Classes under the base package whose simple name ends with Converter.

## Check

Each resides in an adapter package of some module root (<module>.adapter..), incoming or outgoing. Only the Converter suffix is checked - a class named *Mapper or *Assembler is not selected by this rule. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types under the root namespace whose name ends with Converter.

**Check.** Each resides in an adapter namespace of some module root (<module>.Adapter or below), incoming or outgoing. Only the Converter suffix is checked - a type named *Mapper or *Assembler is not selected by this rule. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-NAM-008",
        "Converters must reside in the adapter layer",
        "Converters/Mappers translate between layers and should be in adapters",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith("Converter")
                .and()
                .resideInAnyPackage(layout.basePackage() + "..")
                .should()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allAdapterPatterns())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting("Classes under the base package whose simple name ends with Converter.")
    .checking(
        "Each resides in an adapter package of some module root (<module>.adapter..), incoming"
            + " or outgoing. Only the Converter suffix is checked - a class named *Mapper or"
            + " *Assembler is not selected by this rule. An empty selection passes.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allAdapterPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
