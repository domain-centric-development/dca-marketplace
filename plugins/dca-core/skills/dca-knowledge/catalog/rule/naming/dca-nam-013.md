# Use cases, input ports and published operations must not be named after a field they write

**Experimental.** This rule is binding only in a project that opted in to experimental rules - the architecture test calls `withExperimental()` (.NET: `WithExperimental()`) on its rule selection, or `dca-archunit.properties` sets `dca.rules.experimental = true`; without that opt-in the rule does not run and is information only, never a finding and never a reason to change code.

## Selection

Non-nested types in <module>.application.. of every module root that are assignable to the configured input-port role - interfaces and classes - and classes whose simple name ends with the configured use-case suffix; and the public methods of every non-nested type in the published api package of every module root (<module>.<api>..).

## Check

No selected type name - with the use-case suffix or InputPort removed - and no selected method name starts with set or update followed by a capital (SetLimit, updateStatus). settle and updated are not matched. Whether the remaining verb is in the glossary is not checked. The events package is not selected. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Interfaces in <module>.Application of every module root assignable to IInputPort, concrete application operations selected by IInputPort assignability or the configured use-case suffix, and the public methods declared by types in <module>.Api and below of every module root. Type names are read without the interface's I prefix and the generic arity.

**Check.** No selected name starts with Set or Update followed by an upper-case letter. Property accessors and other compiler-named methods are not methods in this sense, and a name such as Settle or Updated passes. Whether another verb names a field is not checked. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java

## Helpers

### `operations`

```java
/** The input ports and use cases of every module, nested types left out. */
  private static List<JavaClass> operations(DcaArchitecture arch, DcaLayout layout) {
    List<JavaClass> operations = new ArrayList<>();
    for (JavaClass type : arch.classes()) {
      if (!type.isNestedClass()
          && !type.isAnonymousClass()
          && JavaClass.Predicates.resideInAnyPackage(arch.allApplicationPatterns()).test(type)
          && (type.isAssignableTo(layout.markers().inputPort())
              || (!type.isInterface() && type.getSimpleName().endsWith(layout.useCaseSuffix())))) {
        operations.add(type);
      }
    }
    return operations;
  }
```

### `operationName`

```java
/** The simple name without the use-case suffix or {@code InputPort}. */
  private static String operationName(JavaClass type, DcaLayout layout) {
    String name = type.getSimpleName();
    for (String suffix : List.of(layout.useCaseSuffix(), "InputPort")) {
      if (name.endsWith(suffix) && name.length() > suffix.length()) {
        return name.substring(0, name.length() - suffix.length());
      }
    }
    return name;
  }
```

### `publishedApiPatterns`

```java
private static String[] publishedApiPatterns(DcaArchitecture arch) {
  return arch.moduleRoots().stream()
      .map(root -> root + "." + arch.layout().apiSubpackage() + "..")
      .toArray(String[]::new);
}
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allApplicationPatterns()`, `classes()`, `layout()`, `moduleRoots()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
