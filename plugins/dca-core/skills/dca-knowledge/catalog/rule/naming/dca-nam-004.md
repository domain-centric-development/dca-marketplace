# Repository Interfaces must end with 'Repository' (name-based discovery)

## Selection

Interfaces in <module>.application.. of every module root whose simple name contains Repository, except one named exactly Repository.

## Check

The simple name ends with Repository (RepositoryPort or ProductRepositoryAdapter is reported). Selection is by name only - whether the interface extends the Repository marker is not checked, and classes are not selected. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Interfaces in <module>.Application of every module root whose name contains Repository, except one named exactly Repository or IRepository.

**Check.** The name ends with Repository (IRepositoryPort or IProductRepositoryAdapter is reported). Selection is by name only - whether the interface extends the IRepository marker is not checked, and classes are not selected. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-NAM-004",
        "Repository Interfaces must end with 'Repository' (name-based discovery)",
        "Repository interfaces should follow consistent naming conventions (DDD pattern)",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allApplicationPatterns())
                .and()
                .areInterfaces()
                .and()
                .haveSimpleNameContaining("Repository")
                .and()
                .doNotHaveSimpleName("Repository")
                .should()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith("Repository")
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Interfaces in <module>.application.. of every module root whose simple name contains"
            + " Repository, except one named exactly Repository.")
    .checking(
        "The simple name ends with Repository (RepositoryPort or ProductRepositoryAdapter is"
            + " reported). Selection is by name only - whether the interface extends the"
            + " Repository marker is not checked, and classes are not selected. An empty"
            + " selection passes.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allApplicationPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).

            var violations = arch.Interfaces
                .Where(i => InNamespace(i, DcaLayout.AnyOf(arch.AllApplicationPatterns()))

                .Select(i => $"{i.FullName} does not end with 'Repository'")
                .ToList();
            DcaRule.Fail("Repository Interfaces must end with 'Repository'", violations, "rename the interface to I<Aggregate>Repository");
