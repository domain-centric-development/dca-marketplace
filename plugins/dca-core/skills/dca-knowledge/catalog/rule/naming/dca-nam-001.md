# Application layer InputPort implementations must end with 'UseCase'

## Selection

Non-interface, non-record classes in <module>.application.. of every module root that are assignable to the configured use-case role - through the interface or an intermediate base class.

## Check

The simple name ends with the configured use-case suffix. Interfaces and records are not selected; a class assignable only to the input-port role without the use-case role is not selected either. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-record classes in <module>.Application of every module root that implement IUseCase<TInput, TOutput> - directly or through an I*InputPort interface that extends it.

**Check.** The name ends with the configured use-case suffix. Interfaces and records are not selected; a class implementing only IInputPort without IUseCase is not selected either. An empty selection passes.

## Rust reading

Unpublished (dca-rust); the suite implements it. **Held by** a lint or a test (source-test).

**Selection.** Types in application crates that implement an input port.

**Check.** The name ends with UseCase.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-NAM-001",
        "Application layer InputPort implementations must end with '"
            + layout.useCaseSuffix()
            + "'",
        "InputPort implementations (use cases) should follow consistent naming conventions"
            + " (Hexagonal Architecture)",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that(arch.inApplication())
                .and()
                .areNotInterfaces()
                .and()
                .areNotRecords()
                .and(arch.layout().markers().is("useCase"))
                .should()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith(layout.useCaseSuffix())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Non-interface, non-record classes in <module>.application.. of every module root that"
            + " are assignable to the configured use-case role - through the interface or an"
            + " intermediate base class.")
    .checking(
        "The simple name ends with the configured use-case suffix. Interfaces and records are"
            + " not selected; a class assignable only to the input-port role without the"
            + " use-case role is not selected either. An empty selection passes.",
        "rename the class to *" + layout.useCaseSuffix())
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `inApplication()`, `layout()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
### C# expression

        arch => SelectionArchRule.ForEach(
            "input port implementations in the application layer should end with the use-case suffix",
            () => arch.Classes.Where(c => arch.InApplication(c) && c.IsRecord != true && ImplementsUseCase(arch, c)),
            c => c.Name.EndsWith(arch.Layout.UseCaseSuffix, StringComparison.Ordinal)
                ? []
                : [$"{c.FullName} implements an input port but does not end with '{arch.Layout.UseCaseSuffix}'"]))
    .Selecting(
        "Non-record classes in <module>.Application of every module root that implement"
            + " IUseCase<TInput, TOutput> - directly or through an I*InputPort interface that"
            + " extends it.")
