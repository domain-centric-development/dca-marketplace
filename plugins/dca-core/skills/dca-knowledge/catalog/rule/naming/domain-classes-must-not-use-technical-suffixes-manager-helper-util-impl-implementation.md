## Selection

Classes in <module>.domain.. of every module root.

## Check

No simple name ends with Manager, Helper, Util, Utils, Impl or Implementation. Only these six suffixes are checked, only in domain packages - a *Service or *Factory in the domain is not reported, and an Impl in an adapter package is not checked. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types in <module>.Domain of every module root.

**Check.** No name ends with Manager, Helper, Util, Utils, Impl or Implementation. Only these six suffixes are checked, only in domain namespaces - a *Service or *Factory in the domain is not reported, and an Impl in an adapter namespace is not checked. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-NAM-010",
        "Domain classes must not use technical suffixes (Manager, Helper, Util, Impl, Implementation)",
        "Domain names come from the ubiquitous language - name services by their specialty, not by"
            + " technical role",
        arch ->
            noClasses()
                .that()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allDomainPatterns())
                .should()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith("Manager")
                .orShould()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith("Helper")
                .orShould()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith("Util")
                .orShould()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith("Utils")
                .orShould()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith("Impl")
                .orShould()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith("Implementation")
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting("Classes in <module>.domain.. of every module root.")
    .checking(
        "No simple name ends with Manager, Helper, Util, Utils, Impl or Implementation. Only these six"
            + " suffixes are checked, only in domain packages - a *Service or *Factory in the"

            + " empty selection passes.")
