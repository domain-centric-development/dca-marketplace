title: "Diagnostic: adapters that publish an enum by its member name"
rule: A value an adapter publishes from an enum is spelled explicitly - a code per value on the enum or a mapping in the adapter - never derived from the member's name. Renaming a member is a refactoring inside the code and must not change what a client reads.
constraint: "Diagnostic: adapters that publish an enum by its member name."
selects: "Classes in <module>.adapter.. of every module root, incoming and outgoing, and their method calls whose target is an enum declared in <module>.domain.. or <module>.application.."
checks: "Informational diagnostic only: lists every call of name() or toString() on such an enum - inside a string concatenation as well - and never fails. The enum value itself concatenated (\"text\" + value) or passed to a formatting or string-building call reaches the platform as an Object - the compiler erases its type from the call - so it is not visible and is not listed, nor is a serializer that writes the name on its own; whether the value leaves the process is not established either."

# Diagnostic: adapters that publish an enum by its member name

**Experimental.** This rule is binding only in a project that opted in to experimental rules - the architecture test calls `withExperimental()` (.NET: `WithExperimental()`) on its rule selection, or `dca-archunit.properties` sets `dca.rules.experimental = true`; without that opt-in the rule does not run and is information only, never a finding and never a reason to change code.

## Selection

Classes in <module>.adapter.. of every module root, incoming and outgoing, and their method calls whose target is an enum declared in <module>.domain.. or <module>.application..

## Check

Informational diagnostic only: lists every call of name() or toString() on such an enum - inside a string concatenation as well - and never fails. The enum value itself concatenated ("text" + value) or passed to a formatting or string-building call reaches the platform as an Object - the compiler erases its type from the call - so it is not visible and is not listed, nor is a serializer that writes the name on its own; whether the value leaves the process is not established either.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-nested types in <module>.Adapter of every module root, incoming and outgoing, with their runtime type in the loaded assemblies, together with their nested, async state-machine and closure types; enums declared in a domain or application namespace of any module root.

**Check.** Informational diagnostic only: lists a method that turns such an enum into its member name as the IL shows it - ToString in any overload, called through a constrained call or on the boxed value; the boxed value passed straight into a string-building call (concatenation, formatting, joining, appending); an interpolation hole of the enum type; Enum.GetName or Enum.GetNames over it - and never fails. Compiler-generated methods, such as a record's generated PrintMembers and ToString, are not read. A boxed value stored first and formatted later, a serializer that writes names, and a name read through a generic helper are not seen; whether the text reaches a client stays with review.

## Implementation

The verbatim ArchUnit expression is in the evidence slice [Overview](/evidence/rule/hexagonal/dca-hex-016/overview.md); every helper it calls has a slice of its own, listed under *Evidence slices* below.

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allAdapterPatterns()`, `allApplicationPatterns()`, `allDomainPatterns()`, `classes()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
