# Output Ports in application.shared must extend OutputPort

## Selection

Top-level interfaces in <module>.application.<shared>.. of every module root, excluding package-info. Nested interfaces are not selected - they belong to their enclosing port's contract.

## Check

The interface is assignable to OutputPort, directly or through Repository, Store, DomainEventPublisher, IntegrationEventPublisher or another OutputPort sub-interface. Classes, records and enums in application.shared are not checked. An empty selection passes. The rule presumes the vocabulary has a common port root: withOutputPort must be set whenever any port role is, because every port of the project is measured against it. A vocabulary that has no such root has nothing this rule can assert - switch the id off rather than pointing the role at an unrelated type.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Top-level interfaces in <module>.Application.Shared of every module root. Nested interfaces are not selected - they belong to their enclosing port's contract.

**Check.** The interface is assignable to IOutputPort, directly or through IRepository, IStore, IDomainEventPublisher, IIntegrationEventPublisher or another IOutputPort sub-interface. Classes, records and enums in Application.Shared are not checked. An empty selection passes. The rule presumes the vocabulary has a common port root: OutputPort must be set whenever any port role is, because every port of the project is measured against it. A vocabulary that has no such root has nothing this rule can assert - switch the id off rather than pointing the role at an unrelated type.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-HEX-009",
        "Output Ports in application.shared must extend OutputPort",
        "Top-level interfaces in application.shared are output ports and must extend OutputPort to"
            + " be part of the port hierarchy. Nested interfaces (e.g. IdentityProvider.Identity)"
            + " are part of their enclosing port's contract, not ports themselves",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allSharedOutputPortPatterns())
                .and()
                .areInterfaces()
                .and()
                .areTopLevelClasses()
                .and()
                .haveSimpleNameNotEndingWith("package-info")
                .should()
                .beAssignableTo(arch.layout().markers().outputPort())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Top-level interfaces in <module>.application.<shared>.. of every module root,"
            + " excluding package-info. Nested interfaces are not selected - they belong to"
            + " their enclosing port's contract.")
    .checking(
        "The interface is assignable to OutputPort, directly or through Repository,"
            + " Store, DomainEventPublisher, IntegrationEventPublisher or another OutputPort"
            + " sub-interface. Classes, records and enums in application.shared are not checked."
            + " An empty selection passes. The rule presumes the vocabulary has a common port"
            + " root: withOutputPort must be set whenever any port role is, because every port"
            + " of the project is measured against it. A vocabulary that has no such root has"
            + " nothing this rule can assert - switch the id off rather than pointing the role"
            + " at an unrelated type.")
