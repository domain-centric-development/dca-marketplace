## Selection

Classes anywhere on the classpath under scan whose simple name ends with the literal Controller or with the configured REST-controller suffix. Selected by name, not by annotation, and not restricted to adapter packages.

## Check

No dependency on a class assignable to Repository - the port interface or an implementation. Other output ports (Store, event publishers) are not checked; a controller that reaches a repository through another class is not reported. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Controller classes anywhere in the loaded assemblies: a class whose name ends with the literal Controller or with the configured REST-controller suffix, one deriving from the configured controller or page-model base class, or one carrying the configured API-controller attribute. Not restricted to adapter namespaces.

**Check.** No dependency on a type assignable to IRepository - the port interface or an implementation. Other output ports (IStore, event publishers) are not checked; a controller that reaches a repository through another class is not reported. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-HEX-003",
        "Controllers and Resources must never access repositories directly",
        "Controllers must go through use cases (input ports), never directly to repositories",
        arch ->
            noClasses()
                .that()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith("Controller")
                .or()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith(layout.restControllerSuffix())
                .should()
                .dependOnClassesThat()
                .areAssignableTo(Repository.class)
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Classes anywhere on the classpath under scan whose simple name ends with the"
            + " literal Controller or with the configured REST-controller suffix. Selected by"
            + " name, not by annotation, and not restricted to adapter packages.")
    .checking(
        "No dependency on a class assignable to Repository - the port interface or an"
            + " implementation. Other output ports (Store, event publishers) are not checked; a"
            + " controller that reaches a repository through another class is not reported. An"
            + " empty selection passes.")
