title: Event listeners that drive an input port must run after the commit in their own transaction
rule: "A reaction to an event changes state or performs an external effect through a use case. Run inside the transaction that raised the event, it changes a second aggregate in the first one's transaction, a failure in the reaction rolls back the fact that caused it, and a retry of the request runs the reaction again. A listener that only translates or measures calls output ports and may run in that transaction."
constraint: Event listeners that drive an input port must run after the commit in their own transaction.
selects: "Classes of every module root; within them, the methods carrying, directly or as a meta-annotation, an annotation of the configured event-listener role - on the method or on one of its parameters, where CDI puts its observer. With an empty event-listener or transactional-event-listener role nothing is selected and the rule passes."
checks: "A selected method that - itself or a method of the same class it reaches through calls within the class - calls a type assignable to the configured input-port role carries, directly or as a meta-annotation, an annotation of the configured transactional-event-listener role - on the method or a parameter; an entry <annotation>#<attribute>=<value> asks for that attribute value, as CDI's observer phase - and an annotation of the configured transactional role on the method or its class. The rule reads the listener's phase and transaction, not whether a durable publication store backs it; an input port reached through a second class is not followed. An empty selection passes."

# Event listeners that drive an input port must run after the commit in their own transaction

**Experimental.** This rule is binding only in a project that opted in to experimental rules - the architecture test calls `withExperimental()` (.NET: `WithExperimental()`) on its rule selection, or `dca-archunit.properties` sets `dca.rules.experimental = true`; without that opt-in the rule does not run and is information only, never a finding and never a reason to change code.

## Selection

Classes of every module root; within them, the methods carrying, directly or as a meta-annotation, an annotation of the configured event-listener role - on the method or on one of its parameters, where CDI puts its observer. With an empty event-listener or transactional-event-listener role nothing is selected and the rule passes.

## Check

A selected method that - itself or a method of the same class it reaches through calls within the class - calls a type assignable to the configured input-port role carries, directly or as a meta-annotation, an annotation of the configured transactional-event-listener role - on the method or a parameter; an entry <annotation>#<attribute>=<value> asks for that attribute value, as CDI's observer phase - and an annotation of the configured transactional role on the method or its class. The rule reads the listener's phase and transaction, not whether a durable publication store backs it; an input port reached through a second class is not followed. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Classes of every module root assignable to a type of the configured event-listener role and to none of the configured transactional-event-listener role. With either role empty - both are empty in every preset - nothing is selected and the rule passes.

**Check.** No method of such a class - async state machines and lambdas included - calls a method of a type assignable to IInputPort. The rule reads the listener's kind, not whether an outbox backs it; an input port reached through a second class is not followed. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

The verbatim ArchUnit expression is in the evidence slice [Overview](/evidence/rule/hexagonal/dca-hex-017/overview.md); every helper it calls has a slice of its own, listed under *Evidence slices* below.
