List<String> contextPackages = boundedContexts.keySet().toList()

expect:
// Dynamically check each bounded context's incoming adapters
// They must not access any other bounded context
// Exception: Event consumers may access other contexts' integration events
// Note: Open Host Services (api/ packages) are designed to BE ACCESSED by other contexts,
// but they themselves should not access other contexts
contextPackages.each { contextPackage ->

  List<String> otherContexts = contextPackages.findAll { it != contextPackage }
