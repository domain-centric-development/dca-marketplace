title: GET handlers must not drive an input port that takes a command
rule: "A state-changing use case is reached only by an unsafe HTTP method, never by GET. Links, prefetching, crawlers and cross-site navigation issue GET requests on their own; a GET that runs a command changes state nobody asked to change."
constraint: GET handlers must not drive an input port that takes a command.
selects: "Classes in <module>.adapter.incoming.. of every module root that are directly annotated with one of the configured web-controller stereotypes; within them, the methods carrying, directly or as a meta-annotation, an annotation of the configured GET-mapping role."
checks: "No such method - or a method of the same class it reaches through calls within the class - calls a type assignable to the configured input-port role whose input ends with Command: a parameter of the called method, of a public method of the port, or a type argument of the input port it extends. A mapping that names its HTTP method in an attribute is not read. With an empty web-controller or GET-mapping role nothing is selected and the rule passes."

# GET handlers must not drive an input port that takes a command

**Experimental.** This rule is binding only in a project that opted in to experimental rules - the architecture test calls `withExperimental()` (.NET: `WithExperimental()`) on its rule selection, or `dca-archunit.properties` sets `dca.rules.experimental = true`; without that opt-in the rule does not run and is information only, never a finding and never a reason to change code.

## Selection

Classes in <module>.adapter.incoming.. of every module root that are directly annotated with one of the configured web-controller stereotypes; within them, the methods carrying, directly or as a meta-annotation, an annotation of the configured GET-mapping role.

## Check

No such method - or a method of the same class it reaches through calls within the class - calls a type assignable to the configured input-port role whose input ends with Command: a parameter of the called method, of a public method of the port, or a type argument of the input port it extends. A mapping that names its HTTP method in an attribute is not read. With an empty web-controller or GET-mapping role nothing is selected and the rule passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Methods declared by classes in <module>.Adapter.Incoming of every module root that carry an attribute of the configured GET-mapping role (derived attributes included), or - on a class recognised as a controller or page model - whose name starts with a configured GET-handler prefix. Both roles are empty in the None() preset, which then selects nothing.

**Check.** No method reached from the handler through calls within the class - async state machines and lambdas included - calls a method of a type assignable to IInputPort that takes a parameter whose type name ends in Command. A handler mapped by a routing call rather than by an attribute or a name is not seen, and a command reached through a second class is not followed. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

The verbatim ArchUnit expression is in the evidence slice [Overview](/evidence/rule/hexagonal/dca-hex-014/overview.md); every helper it calls has a slice of its own, listed under *Evidence slices* below.

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allIncomingAdapterPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
