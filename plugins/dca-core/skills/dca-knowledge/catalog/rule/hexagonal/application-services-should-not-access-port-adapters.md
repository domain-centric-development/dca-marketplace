## Selection

Classes in <module>.application.. of every module root, application.shared included.

## Check

No dependency on a class in <module>.adapter.. of any module root. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types in <module>.Application of every module root, Application.Shared included.

**Check.** No dependency on a type in <module>.Adapter of any module root. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-HEX-002",
        "Application Services should not access port adapters",
        "Application services should only depend on domain and outbound ports, not adapters",
        arch ->
            noClasses()
                .that()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allApplicationPatterns())
                .should()
                .dependOnClassesThat()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allAdapterPatterns())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Classes in <module>.application.. of every module root, application.shared"
            + " included.")
    .checking(
        "No dependency on a class in <module>.adapter.. of any module root. An empty"
            + " selection passes.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allAdapterPatterns()`, `allApplicationPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
