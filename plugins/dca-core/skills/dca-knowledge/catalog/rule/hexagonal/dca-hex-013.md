title: Outgoing Adapters must not depend on input ports
rule: "An outgoing adapter is driven: the application calls it through an output port. One that calls an input port drives the application instead - it is an incoming adapter filed on the wrong side, and the call it makes runs a second use case from inside the first one's outgoing edge."
constraint: Outgoing Adapters must not depend on input ports.
selects: "Classes in <module>.adapter.outgoing.. of every module root."
checks: "No dependency on a type assignable to InputPort - the input port interfaces and the use case classes implementing them, of any module. Calling another module's published api is not a dependency on an input port, even where that api delegates to one - only direct dependencies are read. An empty selection passes."

# Outgoing Adapters must not depend on input ports

## Selection

Classes in <module>.adapter.outgoing.. of every module root.

## Check

No dependency on a type assignable to InputPort - the input port interfaces and the use case classes implementing them, of any module. Calling another module's published api is not a dependency on an input port, even where that api delegates to one - only direct dependencies are read. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Classes in <module>.Adapter.Outgoing of every module root.

**Check.** No dependency on a type assignable to IInputPort - the input port interfaces and the use case classes implementing them, of any module. Calling another module's published api is not a dependency on an input port, even where that api delegates to one - only direct dependencies are read; constructor parameters are read from the runtime type as well, so a port injected into an adapter whose members are all async is still found. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-HEX-013",
        "Outgoing Adapters must not depend on input ports",
        "An outgoing adapter is driven: the application calls it through an output port. One that"
            + " calls an input port drives the application instead - it is an incoming adapter"
            + " filed on the wrong side, and the call it makes runs a second use case from inside"
            + " the first one's outgoing edge",
        arch ->
            noClasses()
                .that()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allOutgoingAdapterPatterns())
                .should()
                .dependOnClassesThat()
                .areAssignableTo(arch.layout().markers().inputPort())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting("Classes in <module>.adapter.outgoing.. of every module root.")
    .checking(
        "No dependency on a type assignable to InputPort - the input port interfaces and the use"
            + " case classes implementing them, of any module. Calling another module's published"
            + " api is not a dependency on an input port, even where that api delegates to one"
            + " - only direct dependencies are read. An empty selection passes.",
        "move the class to the incoming adapter package, or let the use case reach the"
            + " capability through an output port")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allOutgoingAdapterPatterns()`, `layout()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
