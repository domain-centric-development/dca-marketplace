# Incoming adapters must only access their own bounded context (except event consumers and Open Host Services)

## Selection

Per isolated module root - every module root except the shared kernel, declared a bounded context or not: classes in <module>.adapter.incoming.., excluding those below the configured event-consumer sub-package (adapter.incoming.event by default). A module that is the only isolated module is skipped.

## Check

No dependency on a class in another isolated module root (<other>..) unless that class lives in the other module's published packages <other>.api.. or <other>.events.. (segment names from the layout) - the same allow-list DCA-STR-006 applies to outgoing adapters. The other module's domain, application, adapter and infrastructure packages are internal and reported. Event consumers are exempt entirely. Dependencies on the shared kernel and on packages outside every module root are not checked. Findings of all modules are collected and reported together; a module without incoming adapters passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Per isolated module root - every module root except the shared kernel, declared a bounded context or not: types in <module>.Adapter.Incoming, excluding those below the configured event-consumer segment (Adapter.Incoming.Event by default). A module that is the only isolated module is skipped.

**Check.** No dependency on a type in another isolated module root (<other> and below) unless that type lives in the other module's published namespaces <other>.Api or <other>.Events and below (segment names from the layout) - the same allow-list DCA-STR-006 applies to outgoing adapters. The other module's Domain, Application, Adapter and Infrastructure namespaces are internal and reported. Event consumers are exempt entirely. Dependencies on the shared kernel and on namespaces outside every module root are not checked. Findings of all modules are collected and reported together; a module without incoming adapters passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.check(
        "DCA-HEX-007",
        "Incoming adapters must only access their own bounded context (except event consumers and"
            + " Open Host Services)",

            + " integration events or the published api for cross-context integration",
        arch -> {
          // Structural, over every module that owns a DCA layer - declared as a bounded context
          // or not - so an undeclared module can neither reach out nor be reached into. The
          // allow-list is the same package convention DCA-STR-006 applies to outgoing adapters:
          // another module's published api and events packages are open, everything else in it
          // is internal.
          List<ArchRule> perModule = new ArrayList<>();
          for (String module : arch.isolatedModuleRoots()) {
            String[] otherModules = arch.moduleRootPatternsExcluding(module);
            if (otherModules.length == 0) {
              continue;

            String[] published = arch.publishedPackagePatternsExcluding(module);

          CollectedViolations.check(perModule, arch.classes());
        })
    .selecting(

## Helpers

### `eventConsumerPattern`

```java
/**
   * Pattern of event consumers - the incoming adapters that react to other modules' integration
   * events; every segment comes from the layout.
   */
  private String eventConsumerPattern() {
    return layout.incomingEventAdapterPattern();
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.check`

```java
/** Evaluates every rule, then throws all their violations at once. */
  static void check(List<ArchRule> rules, JavaClasses classes) {
    CollectedViolations collected = withoutHeader();
    rules.forEach(rule -> collected.addAll(rule, classes));
    collected.throwIfAny();
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.add`

```java
/** Records one violation. */
  void add(String violation) {
    violations.add(Objects.requireNonNull(violation, "violation"));
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.withoutHeader`

```java
/** A collector whose report is the bare list of violations. */
  static CollectedViolations withoutHeader() {
    return new CollectedViolations("");
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.addAll`

```java
/**
   * Evaluates one ArchUnit rule and records each of its violation details, suffixed with the
   * explanation of what the rule was checking — the detail alone ({@code Class A depends on B})
   * does not say why that dependency is wrong.
   */
  void addAll(ArchRule rule, JavaClasses classes, String explanation) {
    for (String detail : rule.evaluate(classes).getFailureReport().getDetails()) {
      add(explanation.isEmpty() ? detail : detail + " - " + explanation);
    }
  }

/** Evaluates one ArchUnit rule and records its violation details as they are. */
  void addAll(ArchRule rule, JavaClasses classes) {
    addAll(rule, classes, "");
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.throwIfAny`

```java
/**
   * Throws the collected violations as one {@link DcaRuleViolation}; nothing when there are none.
   */
  void throwIfAny() {
    if (!violations.isEmpty()) {
      throw new DcaRuleViolation(header, violations);
    }
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.isEmpty`

```java
boolean isEmpty() {
  return violations.isEmpty();
}
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `classes()`, `contextName()`, `isolatedModuleRoots()`, `moduleRootPatternsExcluding()`, `publishedPackagePatternsExcluding()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
