```groovy
given:
Map<String, BoundedContext> boundedContexts = discoverBoundedContextPackages()
List<String> contextPackages = boundedContexts.keySet().toList()

expect:
// This is a "positive" test documenting the allowed pattern:
// Outgoing adapters may access api/ packages from other contexts (Open Host Services)
// This is verified by the successful compilation and the stricter tests in DddStrategicPatternsArchUnitTest
// that ensure outgoing adapters do NOT access domain or application layers of other contexts
true // Pattern verification: outgoing adapters call Open Host Services via api/ packages
```
