title: Incoming Adapters must not depend on domain services
rule: "An incoming adapter translates external input, calls an input port and formats its result. Injecting or invoking a domain service bypasses the application boundary; the use case owns that collaboration and puts its outcome into the result. Outgoing adapters are outside this rule - repositories and other driven adapters may construct or reconstitute domain objects while implementing output ports."
constraint: Incoming Adapters must not depend on domain services.
