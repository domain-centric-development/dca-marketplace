## Selection

Classes in <module>.adapter.incoming.. of every module root, excluding those below an adapter.incoming.event package (event consumers).

## Check

No dependency on a class in <module>.adapter.outgoing.. of any module root. The reverse direction (an outgoing adapter using an incoming one) and dependencies between two incoming or two outgoing adapters are not checked. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types in <module>.Adapter.Incoming of every module root, excluding those below an Adapter.Incoming.Event namespace (event consumers).

**Check.** No dependency on a type in <module>.Adapter.Outgoing of any module root. The reverse direction (an outgoing adapter using an incoming one) and dependencies between two incoming or two outgoing adapters are not checked. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-HEX-006",
        "Port adapters (incoming and outgoing) must not communicate directly with each other"
            + " within the same context",
        "Port adapters should communicate through application services, not directly (event"
            + " consumers are the exception)",
        arch ->
            noClasses()
                .that()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allIncomingAdapterPatterns())
                .and()
                .resideOutsideOfPackage(eventConsumerPattern())
                .should()
                .dependOnClassesThat()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allOutgoingAdapterPatterns())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Classes in <module>.adapter.incoming.. of every module root, excluding those"
            + " below an adapter.incoming.event package (event consumers).")
    .checking(
        "No dependency on a class in <module>.adapter.outgoing.. of any module root. The"
            + " reverse direction (an outgoing adapter using an incoming one) and dependencies"
            + " between two incoming or two outgoing adapters are not checked. An empty"
            + " selection passes.")
```

## Helpers

### `eventConsumerPattern`

```java
/** Pattern of event consumers, which may depend on other contexts' integration events. */
  private String eventConsumerPattern() {
    return ".." + layout.adapterSubpackage() + "." + layout.incomingSubpackage() + ".event..";
  }
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allIncomingAdapterPatterns()`, `allOutgoingAdapterPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
