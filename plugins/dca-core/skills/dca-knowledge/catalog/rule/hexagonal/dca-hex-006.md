# Incoming port adapters must not depend directly on outgoing port adapters within the same context

## Selection

Classes in <module>.adapter.incoming.. of every module root, excluding those below the configured event-consumer sub-package (adapter.incoming.event by default).

## Check

No dependency on a class in <module>.adapter.outgoing.. of any module root. The reverse direction (an outgoing adapter using an incoming one) and dependencies between two incoming or two outgoing adapters are not checked. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types in <module>.Adapter.Incoming of every module root, excluding those below the configured event-consumer segment (Adapter.Incoming.Event by default).

**Check.** No dependency on a type in <module>.Adapter.Outgoing of any module root. The reverse direction (an outgoing adapter using an incoming one) and dependencies between two incoming or two outgoing adapters are not checked. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-HEX-006",
        "Incoming port adapters must not depend directly on outgoing port adapters"
            + " within the same context",
        "Port adapters should communicate through application services, not directly (event"
            + " consumers are the exception)",
        arch ->
            noClasses()
                .that()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allIncomingAdapterPatterns())
                .and()
                .resideOutsideOfPackage(eventConsumerPattern())
                .should()
                .dependOnClassesThat()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allOutgoingAdapterPatterns())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Classes in <module>.adapter.incoming.. of every module root, excluding those"
            + " below the configured event-consumer sub-package (adapter.incoming.event by"
            + " default).")
    .checking(
        "No dependency on a class in <module>.adapter.outgoing.. of any module root. The"
            + " reverse direction (an outgoing adapter using an incoming one) and dependencies"
            + " between two incoming or two outgoing adapters are not checked. An empty"
            + " selection passes.")
```

## Helpers

### `eventConsumerPattern`

```java
/**
   * Pattern of event consumers - the incoming adapters that react to other modules' integration
   * events; every segment comes from the layout.
   */
  private String eventConsumerPattern() {
    return layout.incomingEventAdapterPattern();
  }
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allIncomingAdapterPatterns()`, `allOutgoingAdapterPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
