# Output ports must not reside in the domain layer

## Selection

Interfaces anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to OutputPort - the building-block port interfaces themselves included.

## Check

None resides in <module>.domain.. of any module root. Classes implementing an output port are not selected; where an interface outside the domain has to live is not checked here. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Interfaces anywhere in the loaded assemblies that are assignable to IOutputPort - the building-block port interfaces themselves included.

**Check.** None resides in <module>.Domain of any module root. Classes implementing an output port are not selected; where an interface outside the domain has to live is not checked here. An empty selection passes.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-HEX-010",
        "Output ports must not reside in the domain layer",
        "output ports (Repository, Store, OutputPort) are an application-layer concern and must live"
            + " in application/shared/, not domain/",
        arch ->
            noClasses()
                .that()
                .areAssignableTo(OutputPort.class)
                .and()
                .areInterfaces()
                .should()
                .resideInAnyPackage(arch.allDomainPatterns())
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Interfaces anywhere on the classpath under scan that are assignable to"
            + " OutputPort - the building-block port interfaces themselves included.")
    .checking(
        "None resides in <module>.domain.. of any module root. Classes implementing an"
            + " output port are not selected; where an interface outside the domain has to live"
            + " is not checked here. An empty selection passes.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `allDomainPatterns()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
### C# expression

```csharp
DcaRule.Of(
        "DCA-HEX-010",
        "Output ports must not reside in the domain layer",
        "output ports (IRepository, IStore, IOutputPort) are an application-layer concern and must live"
            + " in Application/Shared/, not Domain/",
        arch => Interfaces().That().AreAssignableTo(typeof(IOutputPort))
            .Should().NotResideInNamespaceMatching(DcaLayout.AnyOf(arch.AllDomainPatterns())))
    .Selecting(
        "Interfaces anywhere in the loaded assemblies that are assignable to"
            + " IOutputPort - the building-block port interfaces themselves included.")
    .Checking(
        "None resides in <module>.Domain of any module root. Classes implementing an"
            + " output port are not selected; where an interface outside the domain has to live"
