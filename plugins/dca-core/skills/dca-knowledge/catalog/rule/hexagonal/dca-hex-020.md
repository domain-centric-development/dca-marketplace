rule: "A check that reads nothing but the caller's roles or claims - is this caller staff? - is a property of the exposure and is declared on the route, with the framework's authorization annotation, where a reader of the route sees it and the framework answers an unauthenticated and an unauthorized caller apart. A branch on the caller's roles inside the adapter's code hides the gate and renders whatever status the branch writes. A check that needs the stored data - is this yours? - is not claims-only and belongs to the use case."
constraint: "Diagnostic: incoming adapters that read the caller's roles in their own code."
selects: "Classes in the incoming adapter layer of every module root - by default <module>.adapter.incoming.. - and their method calls, lambdas and nested classes included. Nothing is selected when the configured authorization-annotation role is empty: without a declarative form there is nothing to advise."
checks: "Informational diagnostic only: lists every call of a method whose name asks whether the caller holds a role or an authority - isUserInRole, isInRole, hasRole, hasAnyRole, hasAuthority, hasAnyAuthority - on any owner, and never fails. An expression inside the authorization annotation is a string, not a call, and is not listed. A method that only hands the roles over - roles(), getAuthorities() - is not listed, so an adapter that issues a token or builds the caller's principal passes; for the same reason a role compared by the adapter itself - roles().contains(\"STAFF\") - is not seen, nor is a helper of the project's own - isAdmin(), isStaff() - declared outside the incoming adapter."

# Diagnostic: incoming adapters that read the caller's roles in their own code

**Experimental.** This rule is binding only in a project that opted in to experimental rules - the architecture test calls `withExperimental()` (.NET: `WithExperimental()`) on its rule selection, or `dca-archunit.properties` sets `dca.rules.experimental = true`; without that opt-in the rule does not run and is information only, never a finding and never a reason to change code.

## Selection

Classes in the incoming adapter layer of every module root - by default <module>.adapter.incoming.. - and their method calls, lambdas and nested classes included. Nothing is selected when the configured authorization-annotation role is empty: without a declarative form there is nothing to advise.

## Check

Informational diagnostic only: lists every call of a method whose name asks whether the caller holds a role or an authority - isUserInRole, isInRole, hasRole, hasAnyRole, hasAuthority, hasAnyAuthority - on any owner, and never fails. An expression inside the authorization annotation is a string, not a call, and is not listed. A method that only hands the roles over - roles(), getAuthorities() - is not listed, so an adapter that issues a token or builds the caller's principal passes; for the same reason a role compared by the adapter itself - roles().contains("STAFF") - is not seen, nor is a helper of the project's own - isAdmin(), isStaff() - declared outside the incoming adapter.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Non-nested types in the incoming adapter layer of every module root - by default <Module>.Adapter.Incoming - with their runtime type in the loaded assemblies, together with their nested, async state-machine and closure types, and the calls their IL makes. Nothing is selected when the configured authorization-attribute role is empty: without a declarative form there is nothing to advise.

**Check.** Informational diagnostic only: lists every call of a method whose name asks whether the caller holds a role or an authority - IsInRole, IsUserInRole, HasRole, HasAnyRole, HasAuthority, HasAnyAuthority, compared ignoring case - on any declaring type, and never fails. A policy or role named in the authorization attribute is metadata, not a call, and is not listed. A member that only hands the roles over is not listed, so an adapter that issues a token or builds the caller's principal passes; for the same reason a role compared by the adapter itself - a claim of the role type searched with FindAll or HasClaim - is not seen, nor is a helper of the project's own - IsAdmin(), IsStaff() - declared outside the incoming adapter.

## Rust reading

Unpublished (dca-rust); the suite implements it. **Held by** a lint or a test (source-test).

**Selection.** Functions and methods in the incoming module of every adapters crate, and the router expressions of those crates. Nothing is selected when [workspace.metadata.dca] names neither authorization-extractors (types whose presence in a handler's signature declares a claims-only check, such as a RequireRole<R> extractor) nor authorization-layers (functions whose call in a router's .layer(...) or .route_layer(...) declares it for the routes added before it); both are empty by default.

**Check.** Informational - lists every call in a body, as a method or as a path, named has_role, has_any_role, has_authority, has_any_authority, is_in_role or is_user_in_role, and never fails. A function whose signature names a configured extractor, or whose name appears in the receiver of a .layer(...)/.route_layer(...) call that calls a configured layer function within the same crate, is not listed. Not seen: a handler routed behind a layer in a router another crate builds, a role compared by the handler itself (roles.contains(...)), and a helper of the project's own declared outside the incoming module. Rust has no route annotation; the extractor and the layer are its declarative forms.

## Implementation

The verbatim ArchUnit expression is in the evidence slice [Overview](/evidence/rule/hexagonal/dca-hex-020/overview.md); every helper it calls has a slice of its own, listed under *Evidence slices* below.

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `classes()`, `inIncomingAdapter()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
