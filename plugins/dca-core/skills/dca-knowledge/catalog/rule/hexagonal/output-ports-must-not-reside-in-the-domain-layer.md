```groovy
expect:
// Repository/Store/OutputPort interfaces belong to the application layer (application/shared/),
// never to domain/ - the domain must stay port-free and framework-free. This catches the case
// where a *Repository is declared next to the aggregate in domain.model instead of being moved
// to application.shared, which the rule above cannot detect on its own since it only scopes
// application.shared and silently passes when the port isn't there at all.
