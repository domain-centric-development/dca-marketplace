title: Modules must not access each other in the domain layer
rule: "A domain layer talks to its own module and the shared kernel, nothing else - not even another module's api/. Selects structurally over every module that owns a DCA layer, declared as a bounded context or not."
constraint: Modules must not access each other in the domain layer.
selects: "Classes in <module>.domain.. of every isolated module root - every package below the base package that owns a domain, application or adapter package, declared as a bounded context or not, the shared kernel excluded. A module that is the only isolated root has no foreign target and is skipped."
checks: "No selected class depends on any class in another isolated module root or below it (<other>..) - not even on its published api or events packages. Dependencies on the shared kernel, on the module's own application, adapter and infrastructure packages and on third-party code are not checked by this rule. Violations are collected per module and reported together."

## Selection

Classes in <module>.domain.. of every isolated module root - every package below the base package that owns a domain, application or adapter package, declared as a bounded context or not, the shared kernel excluded. A module that is the only isolated root has no foreign target and is skipped.

## Check

No selected class depends on any class in another isolated module root or below it (<other>..) - not even on its published api or events packages. Dependencies on the shared kernel, on the module's own application, adapter and infrastructure packages and on third-party code are not checked by this rule. Violations are collected per module and reported together.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types in <module>.Domain and below of every isolated module root - every namespace below the root namespace that owns a Domain, Application or Adapter namespace, declared as a bounded context or not, the shared kernel excluded. A module that is the only isolated root has no foreign target and is skipped.

**Check.** No selected type depends on any type in another isolated module root or below it (<other> and below) - not even on its published Api or Events namespaces. Dependencies on the shared kernel, on the module's own Application, Adapter and Infrastructure namespaces and on third-party code are not checked by this rule. Violations are collected per module and reported together.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.check(
        "DCA-STR-004",
        "Modules must not access each other in the domain layer",
        "A domain layer talks to its own module and the shared kernel, nothing else - not even"
            + " another module's api/. Selects structurally over every module that owns a DCA layer,"
            + " declared as a bounded context or not",
        arch -> {
          List<ArchRule> perModule = new ArrayList<>();
          for (String source : arch.isolatedModuleRoots()) {
            String[] forbidden = arch.moduleRootPatternsExcluding(source);
            if (forbidden.length == 0) {
              continue;
            }
            perModule.add(
                noClasses()
                    .that()
                    .resideInAPackage(layout.domainPattern(source))
                    .should()
                    .dependOnClassesThat()
                    .resideInAnyPackage(forbidden)
                    .allowEmptyShould(true)
                    .because(
                        "The domain layer of module '"
                            + arch.contextName(source)
                            + "' must depend on nothing outside its own module and the shared"
                            + " kernel"));
          }
          CollectedViolations.check(perModule, arch.classes());
        })
    .selecting(
        "Classes in <module>.domain.. of every isolated module root - every package below the"
            + " base package that owns a domain, application or adapter package, declared as a"
            + " bounded context or not, the shared kernel excluded. A module that is the only"
            + " isolated root has no foreign target and is skipped.")
    .checking(
        "No selected class depends on any class in another isolated module root or below it"
            + " (<other>..) - not even on its published api or events packages. Dependencies"
            + " on the shared kernel, on the module's own application, adapter and"
            + " infrastructure packages and on third-party code are not checked by this rule."
            + " Violations are collected per module and reported together.")
```

## Helpers

### `CollectedViolations.check`

```java
/** Evaluates every rule, then throws all their violations at once. */
  static void check(List<ArchRule> rules, JavaClasses classes) {
    CollectedViolations collected = withoutHeader();
    rules.forEach(rule -> collected.addAll(rule, classes));
    collected.throwIfAny();
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.add`

```java
/** Records one violation. */
  void add(String violation) {
    violations.add(Objects.requireNonNull(violation, "violation"));
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.withoutHeader`

```java
/** A collector whose report is the bare list of violations. */
  static CollectedViolations withoutHeader() {
    return new CollectedViolations("");
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.addAll`

```java
/**
   * Evaluates one ArchUnit rule and records each of its violation details, suffixed with the
   * explanation of what the rule was checking — the detail alone ({@code Class A depends on B})
   * does not say why that dependency is wrong.
   */
  void addAll(ArchRule rule, JavaClasses classes, String explanation) {
    for (String detail : rule.evaluate(classes).getFailureReport().getDetails()) {
      add(explanation.isEmpty() ? detail : detail + " - " + explanation);
    }
  }

/** Evaluates one ArchUnit rule and records its violation details as they are. */
  void addAll(ArchRule rule, JavaClasses classes) {
    addAll(rule, classes, "");
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.throwIfAny`

```java
/**
   * Throws the collected violations as one {@link DcaRuleViolation}; nothing when there are none.
   */
  void throwIfAny() {
    if (!violations.isEmpty()) {
      throw new DcaRuleViolation(header, violations);
    }
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.isEmpty`

```java
boolean isEmpty() {
  return violations.isEmpty();
}
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `classes()`, `contextName()`, `isolatedModuleRoots()`, `moduleRootPatternsExcluding()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
