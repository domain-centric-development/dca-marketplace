title: At least one module owns a DCA layer
rule: Without a discovered module root every rule that selects over the layers matches nothing and reports success over an empty model.
constraint: At least one module owns a DCA layer.
selects: "The packages of the imported classes, as a whole - no individual class is reported. A module root is any package that has a subpackage named after one of the configured layer segments, at any depth below the base package."
checks: At least one module root was discovered. The rule says nothing about how many modules there should be or how they are cut; it only establishes that the layer-selecting rules have something to look at. It is the third guard of the same kind as an empty import and an undeclared bounded context.

# At least one module owns a DCA layer

## Selection

The packages of the imported classes, as a whole - no individual class is reported. A module root is any package that has a subpackage named after one of the configured layer segments, at any depth below the base package.

## Check

At least one module root was discovered. The rule says nothing about how many modules there should be or how they are cut; it only establishes that the layer-selecting rules have something to look at. It is the third guard of the same kind as an empty import and an undeclared bounded context.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** The namespaces of the imported types, as a whole - no individual type is reported. A module root is any namespace that has a child namespace named after one of the configured layer segments, at any depth below the root namespace.

**Check.** At least one module root was discovered. The rule says nothing about how many modules there should be or how they are cut; it only establishes that the layer-selecting rules have something to look at. It is the third guard of the same kind as an empty import and an undeclared bounded context.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.check(
        "DCA-STR-012",
        "At least one module owns a DCA layer",
        "Without a discovered module root every rule that selects over the layers matches"
            + " nothing and reports success over an empty model",
        arch -> {
          if (!arch.moduleRoots().isEmpty()) {
            return;
          }
          List<String> segments = new ArrayList<>(arch.layerSegments());
          Collections.sort(segments);
          List<String> observed =
              arch.classes().stream()
                  .map(JavaClass::getPackageName)
                  .distinct()
                  .sorted()
                  .limit(10)
                  .toList();
          throw new DcaRuleViolation(

                  "Check that the base package passed to DcaLayout.forBasePackage is the one"
                      + " the modules live under, and that the import covers them.",
                  "A code base that deliberately has no layered module switches this rule off"
                      + " with a recorded reason."));
        })
    .selecting(
        "The packages of the imported classes, as a whole - no individual class is reported."
            + " A module root is any package that has a subpackage named after one of the"
            + " configured layer segments, at any depth below the base package.")
    .checking(

            + " layer-selecting rules have something to look at. It is the third guard of the"
            + " same kind as an empty import and an undeclared bounded context.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `classes()`, `layerSegments()`, `layout()`, `moduleRoots()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
