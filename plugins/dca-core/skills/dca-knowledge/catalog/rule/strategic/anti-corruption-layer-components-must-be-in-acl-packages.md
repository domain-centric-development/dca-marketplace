## Selection

Classes anywhere on the classpath under scan whose simple name ends with EventTranslator, ACL or AntiCorruptionLayer - selected by name alone, no marker or annotation is read.

## Check

Each resides in a package whose path contains an acl segment (..acl..), at any depth. A translation class named otherwise is neither selected nor checked.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types anywhere below the root namespace whose name ends with EventTranslator, ACL or AntiCorruptionLayer - selected by name alone, no marker or attribute is read.

**Check.** Each resides in a namespace whose path contains an Acl segment, at any depth. A translation class named otherwise is neither selected nor checked.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.of(
        "DCA-STR-009",
        "Anti-Corruption Layer components must be in acl packages",
        "Anti-Corruption Layer components must be in 'acl' packages for clear architectural intent"
            + " (DDD Strategic Pattern)",
        arch ->
            classes()
                .that()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith("EventTranslator")
                .or()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith("ACL")
                .or()
                .haveSimpleNameEndingWith("AntiCorruptionLayer")
                .should()
                .resideInAPackage("..acl..")
                .allowEmptyShould(true))
    .selecting(
        "Classes anywhere on the classpath under scan whose simple name ends with"
            + " EventTranslator, ACL or AntiCorruptionLayer - selected by name alone, no marker"
            + " or annotation is read.")
    .checking(
        "Each resides in a package whose path contains an acl segment (..acl..), at any depth."
            + " A translation class named otherwise is neither selected nor checked.")
