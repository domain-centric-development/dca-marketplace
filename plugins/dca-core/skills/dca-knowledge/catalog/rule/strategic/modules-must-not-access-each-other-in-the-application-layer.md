title: Modules must not access each other in the application layer
rule: "An application layer talks to other modules through its own output ports, implemented by adapters - never directly. Selects structurally over every module that owns a DCA layer, declared as a bounded context or not: an undeclared module must not be able to escape isolation by staying off the context map."
constraint: Modules must not access each other in the application layer.
