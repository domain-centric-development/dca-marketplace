## Selection

Informational - selects nothing and never fails; it carries doctrine only.

## Check

Nothing is asserted. Whether a consumed integration event is translated into the consuming context's own language before it reaches the domain is a code-review check.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.check(
        "DCA-STR-010",
        "Event Listeners consuming integration events should use Anti-Corruption Layer",
        "Consumed integration events are translated into the consuming context's own language"
            + " before they reach its domain — verified by code review, not statically",
        arch -> {})
    .selecting("Informational - selects nothing and never fails; it carries doctrine only.")
    .checking(
        "Nothing is asserted. Whether a consumed integration event is translated into the"
            + " consuming context's own language before it reaches the domain is a code-review"
            + " check.")
```
