# Interfaces in a module's events package must extend IntegrationEvent

## Selection

Top-level interfaces in <module>.<events>.. of every module root, the shared kernel's included, excluding package-info. Annotation types and nested interfaces are not selected - a nested interface belongs to its enclosing contract.

## Check

The interface is assignable to IntegrationEvent, directly or through another interface. Which classes implement it and whether they live in another module are not checked; DCA-ADV-005 and DCA-STR-008 cover the implementing class. An empty selection passes.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Top-level interfaces in <module>.Events and below (segment name from the layout) of every module root, the shared kernel's included. Nested interfaces are not selected - a nested interface belongs to its enclosing contract.

**Check.** The interface is assignable to IIntegrationEvent, directly or through another interface. Which classes implement it and whether they live in another module are not checked; DCA-ADV-005 and DCA-STR-008 cover the implementing class. An empty selection passes.

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `classes()`, `layout()`, `moduleRoots()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
