title: Outgoing adapters accessing other modules must only use their published api/ and events/ packages
rule: "Cross-module communication goes through the target's published api/ (synchronous) and events/ (asynchronous) packages - DCA's in-process contract convention, package names rather than framework annotations - never through its domain, application, adapter or infrastructure packages. Selects structurally over every module that owns a DCA layer, declared as a bounded context or not."
constraint: Outgoing adapters accessing other modules must only use their published api/ and events/ packages.
