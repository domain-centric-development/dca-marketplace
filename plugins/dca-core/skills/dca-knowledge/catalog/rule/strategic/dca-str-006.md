# Outgoing adapters accessing other modules must only use their published api/ and events/ packages

## Selection

Classes in <module>.adapter.outgoing.. of every isolated module root - every package below the base package that owns a domain, application or adapter package, declared as a bounded context or not, the shared kernel excluded. A module that is the only isolated root has no foreign target and is skipped.

## Check

No selected class depends on a class in another isolated module root (<other>..) unless that class lives in the other module's published packages <other>.api.. or <other>.events.. (segment names from the layout). The other module's domain, application, adapter and infrastructure packages are internal and reported. The allow-list is the package convention alone - no framework annotation is read. Dependencies on the shared kernel and on third-party code are not checked.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** Types in <module>.Adapter.Outgoing and below of every isolated module root - every namespace below the root namespace that owns a Domain, Application or Adapter namespace, declared as a bounded context or not, the shared kernel excluded. A module that is the only isolated root has no foreign target and is skipped.

**Check.** No selected type depends on a type in another isolated module root (<other> and below) unless that type lives in the other module's published namespaces <other>.Api or <other>.Events and below (segment names from the layout). The other module's Domain, Application, Adapter and Infrastructure namespaces are internal and reported. The allow-list is the namespace convention alone - no framework attribute is read. Dependencies on the shared kernel and on third-party code are not checked.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.check(
        "DCA-STR-006",
        "Outgoing adapters accessing other modules must only use their published api/ and events/"
            + " packages",

            + " events/ (asynchronous) packages - DCA's in-process contract convention, package"
            + " names rather than framework annotations - never through its domain, application,"
            + " adapter or infrastructure packages. Selects structurally over every module that owns"
            + " a DCA layer, declared as a bounded context or not",

          for (String source : arch.isolatedModuleRoots()) {
            String[] foreign = arch.moduleRootPatternsExcluding(source);
            if (foreign.length == 0) {
              continue;
            }
            String[] published = arch.publishedPackagePatternsExcluding(source);

            + " below the base package that owns a domain, application or adapter package,"
            + " declared as a bounded context or not, the shared kernel excluded. A module that"
            + " is the only isolated root has no foreign target and is skipped.")
    .checking(

## Helpers

### `CollectedViolations.check`

```java
/** Evaluates every rule, then throws all their violations at once. */
  static void check(List<ArchRule> rules, JavaClasses classes) {
    CollectedViolations collected = withoutHeader();
    rules.forEach(rule -> collected.addAll(rule, classes));
    collected.throwIfAny();
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.add`

```java
/** Records one violation. */
  void add(String violation) {
    violations.add(Objects.requireNonNull(violation, "violation"));
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.withoutHeader`

```java
/** A collector whose report is the bare list of violations. */
  static CollectedViolations withoutHeader() {
    return new CollectedViolations("");
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.addAll`

```java
/**
   * Evaluates one ArchUnit rule and records each of its violation details, suffixed with the
   * explanation of what the rule was checking — the detail alone ({@code Class A depends on B})
   * does not say why that dependency is wrong.
   */
  void addAll(ArchRule rule, JavaClasses classes, String explanation) {
    for (String detail : rule.evaluate(classes).getFailureReport().getDetails()) {
      add(explanation.isEmpty() ? detail : detail + " - " + explanation);
    }
  }

/** Evaluates one ArchUnit rule and records its violation details as they are. */
  void addAll(ArchRule rule, JavaClasses classes) {
    addAll(rule, classes, "");
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.throwIfAny`

```java
/**
   * Throws the collected violations as one {@link DcaRuleViolation}; nothing when there are none.
   */
  void throwIfAny() {
    if (!violations.isEmpty()) {
      throw new DcaRuleViolation(header, violations);
    }
  }
```

### `CollectedViolations.isEmpty`

```java
boolean isEmpty() {
  return violations.isEmpty();
}
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `classes()`, `contextName()`, `isolatedModuleRoots()`, `moduleRootPatternsExcluding()`, `publishedPackagePatternsExcluding()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
