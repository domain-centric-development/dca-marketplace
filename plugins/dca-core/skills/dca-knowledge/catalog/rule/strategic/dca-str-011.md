# At least one bounded context is declared

## Selection

The declared bounded contexts of the imported classes — every package whose package-info carries @BoundedContext, at any depth below the base package. No individual class is reported.

## Check

At least one such package exists. The rule says nothing about how many contexts there should be, about their boundaries, or about modules that own a layer without declaring a context — those are governed structurally and are not a substitute for the declaration.

## .NET reading

**Selection.** The declared bounded contexts of the imported types — every namespace carrying a [BoundedContext] marker class, at any depth below the root namespace. No individual type is reported.

**Check.** At least one such namespace exists. The rule says nothing about how many contexts there should be, about their boundaries, or about modules that own a layer without declaring a context — those are governed structurally and are not a substitute for the declaration.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.check(
        "DCA-STR-011",
        "At least one bounded context is declared",
        "Without a declared context the context-map and isolation rules select nothing and"
            + " report success over an empty model",
        arch -> {
          if (arch.boundedContexts().isEmpty()) {
            throw new DcaRuleViolation(
                "No package below the base package '"
                    + arch.layout().basePackage()
                    + "' declares @BoundedContext, so every rule that selects over the"
                    + " discovered contexts passes without having looked at anything.",
                List.of(
                    "Declare the context: a package-info.java carrying @BoundedContext in the"
                        + " root package of each context — a single-context application"
                        + " annotates its base package.",
                    "In a multi-module build, check that the module running the architecture"
                        + " test depends on every module that holds a context.",
                    "A code base that deliberately declares no context switches this rule off"
                        + " with a recorded reason; the structural isolation rules keep"
                        + " governing the modules."));
          }
        })
    .selecting(
        "The declared bounded contexts of the imported classes — every package whose"
            + " package-info carries @BoundedContext, at any depth below the base package. No"
            + " individual class is reported.")
    .checking(
        "At least one such package exists. The rule says nothing about how many contexts there"
            + " should be, about their boundaries, or about modules that own a layer without"
            + " declaring a context — those are governed structurally and are not a substitute"
            + " for the declaration.")
```

## Architecture queries

[DcaArchitecture](/reference/architecture.md) methods the rule relies on: `boundedContexts()`, `layout()` - how they resolve packages is described there and in [DcaLayout](/reference/layout.md).
