# Diagnostic: Event Listeners consuming integration events should use Anti-Corruption Layer

## Selection

Informational - selects nothing and never fails; it carries doctrine only.

## Check

Nothing is asserted. Whether a consumed integration event is translated into the consuming context's own language before it reaches the domain is a code-review check.

## Implementation

```java
DcaRule.informational(
        "DCA-STR-010",
        "Diagnostic: Event Listeners consuming integration events should use Anti-Corruption"
            + " Layer",
        "Consumed integration events are translated into the consuming context's own language"
            + " before they reach its domain — verified by code review, not statically",
        arch -> List.of())
    .selecting("Informational - selects nothing and never fails; it carries doctrine only.")
    .checking(
        "Nothing is asserted. Whether a consumed integration event is translated into the"
            + " consuming context's own language before it reaches the domain is a code-review"
            + " check.")
```

### C# expression

```csharp
DcaRule.Informational(
        "DCA-STR-010",
        "Diagnostic: Event Listeners consuming integration events should use Anti-Corruption Layer",
        "Consumed integration events are translated into the consuming context's own language before they reach"
            + " its domain — verified by code review, not statically",
        arch => Array.Empty<string>())
    .Selecting("Informational - selects nothing and never fails; it carries doctrine only.")
    .Checking(
        "Nothing is asserted. Whether a consumed integration event is translated into the"
            + " consuming context's own language before it reaches the domain is a code-review"
            + " check.")
