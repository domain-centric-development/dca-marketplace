Ordinary use cases do not invoke other use cases, whether directly, through an
input port, or through an application helper. Shared collaborators that do not call
operations remain valid. `DCA-USE-016` follows dependencies within the module's
application layer and reports `Caller -> Target [via Helper]`. Explicit coordination
uses a caller-side exception, for example
`dca.rule.DCA-USE-016.ignore=^com\.example\.module\.application\.coordinate\.CoordinatorUseCase -> `.
This permits the coordinator to invoke operations; it does not permit an operation
to invoke the coordinator, and `DCA-CYC-005` still detects coordination cycles,
including two operations inside the same feature. No coordinator marker is implied.
When a reliable exception cannot be expressed, use WARN with a recorded reason and
review the coordinator's transaction boundaries and partial-failure semantics manually.
Reflection, container lookups and calls through interfaces outside the InputPort
hierarchy also require manual review.

The input port describes the complete effective public instance surface (`DCA-USE-017`).
Declared and inherited business methods, unrelated-interface methods and public
properties/getters/setters must be in the input-port contract. Constructors, Object
members and compiler-generated members are exempt; a property accessor is not exempt
merely because it has a special runtime name. Ordinary, inherited and explicit
input-port implementations are valid. In .NET, `DCA-NET-003` separately validates
`IUseCase<TIn,TOut>.ExecuteAsync(input, CancellationToken)` returning `Task<T>` through
the interface map; it does not count declared public methods.

For every declared ACL interaction, the matching adapter must contain a class that
uses that upstream's channel contract and the declaring context's own domain or
application model (`DCA-MAP-008`). Two translators for different upstreams may share
an adapter package. Evidence for one upstream does not satisfy another interaction.
This identifies a structural translation site, without proving translation quality.
