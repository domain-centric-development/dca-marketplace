Use cases may be registered by configuration or carry an injectable stereotype. A
static reference does not prove registration, and runtime scanning need not leave one;
`DCA-NAM-002` therefore only lists unannotated Java operations as an informational
diagnostic. It never fails. .NET registration is code and has no stereotype counterpart.
Incoming adapters use no infrastructure at all — neither the global one nor their own module's
(`DCA-HEX-004`); the shared kernel's infrastructure is exempt. Outgoing adapters may reuse global and
own-module infrastructure; another module's infrastructure remains private (`DCA-HEX-005`).

Domain metadata is classified by configured roles, including members and composed
metadata. Types prohibit injectable/container, persistence-entity and transactional
roles; fields (and .NET properties) prohibit injection-site and persistence-mapping
roles; methods prohibit transaction and event-listener roles, plus setter injection
except on events; constructors prohibit injection-site metadata. Java detects direct
and meta-annotations. .NET checks an attribute's namespace and every base attribute
type against persistence, injection, transaction and container namespace lists; no
event-listener attribute role is configured by default. Unclassified metadata is
allowed by this check, without claiming it harmless. Events, services, factories and
specifications have exclusive `ADV-004/011/015/018` ownership; `ONI-003` owns the
remaining domain-model types, so one type is never reported twice for metadata.
