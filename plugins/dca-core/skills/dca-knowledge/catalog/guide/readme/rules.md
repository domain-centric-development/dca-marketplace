### THE FUNDAMENTAL DEPENDENCY RULE

- **All dependencies point inward toward domain**
- Domain has zero outward dependencies
- Domain knows nothing about outer layers
- Application depends only on domain
- Adapters depend on application and domain (through interfaces)
- Infrastructure depends on adapters
- Outer layers know inner layers, never reverse
- Inner layers define interfaces, outer layers implement them

### DOMAIN LAYER RULES

#### Entity Rules
- Entity has unique identity
- Identity remains constant throughout lifecycle
- Entities compared by identity only
- Entity can change attributes while keeping identity
- Entity equality based on ID only
- Entity validates its own invariants

#### Value Object Rules
- Value Objects are immutable
- Value Objects have no identity
- Value Objects compared by all attributes
- Replace entire Value Object instead of modifying
- Value Objects can be shared freely
- Value Objects validate themselves
- Side-effect-free methods only

#### Aggregate Rules
- Access external objects only through Aggregate Root
- Aggregate Root is an Entity
- Aggregate defines transactional boundary
- Aggregate maintains invariants at all times
- Small aggregates preferred
- Reference other aggregates by ID only, not object reference
- One transaction modifies one aggregate only
- Eventual consistency between aggregates
- Delete aggregate deletes all contained entities
- Never inject repositories or services into aggregates — pass dependencies as method parameters
- Protect against lost updates with optimistic concurrency: version field on the root, incremented per state change; persistence rejects saves with a stale expected version

#### Domain Service Rules
- Domain Service is stateless
- Use when operation doesn't belong to Entity or Value Object
- Use when operation involves multiple domain objects
- Domain Service operates in domain language
- Domain Service is part of domain layer
- No dependencies on application or outer layers

#### Domain Event Rules (Internal to Bounded Context)
- Domain Events are immutable
- Domain Events use past tense naming (e.g., OrderCreated, not CreateOrder)
- Domain Events represent something that happened in the domain
- Domain Events are defined in `{context}/domain/event/` package
- Domain Events enable eventual consistency within bounded context
- Domain Events emitted by aggregates during state changes
- Domain Events published by use cases via DomainEventPublisher (Output Port)
- Domain Events handled asynchronously when crossing aggregates
- Domain Events must not contain behavior, only data
- Domain Events belong to the domain layer, not adapters

#### Integration Event Rules (Cross-Bounded Context)
- Integration Events are DTOs representing domain events for external systems
- Integration Events defined in `{context}/adapter/outgoing/messaging/event/` package
- Integration Events use past tense + "Event" suffix (e.g., OrderCreatedEvent)
- Integration Events must be serializable (JSON, Protobuf, Avro)
- Integration Events include: event ID, timestamp, correlation ID; the schema version and
  stable logical name are a **class property** via `@IntegrationEventType(name, version)` —
  never a `version` data field on the instance
- Integration Events created by Event Mappers in outgoing adapters
- Domain events never cross bounded context boundaries directly
- Event Mapper converts domain event → integration event DTO
- Integration Events must be backward compatible (add fields, don't remove)
- Integration Events contain only primitives and value types, no domain objects

**Integration Event Payload Styles** — choose per event type:

| Style | Payload | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Notification** | IDs only — consumer queries back via Open Host Service | Sensitive or large data; query-back doubles as authorization gate |
| **Event-Carried State Transfer** | Relevant state snapshot | Consumer maintains a local cache/replica, avoids chatty query-backs |
| **Domain Fact** | The business fact and its data | Consumer reacts to what happened, no replica needed |

Invariant in all styles: flat, serializable, versioned — never aggregate references.

**Decision Tree: Domain Event or Integration Event?**
```
START: Something happened in the domain
   │
   ├─ Does it need to cross bounded context boundaries?
   │     NO → Domain Event only
   │     │     - Define in: {context}/domain/event/
   │     │     - Name: past tense (e.g., OrderCreated)
   │     │     - Contains: domain objects OK
   │     │
   │     YES ↓
   │
   ├─ Create Domain Event FIRST (always)
   │     - Define in: {context}/domain/event/
   │     - Published via DomainEventPublisher
   │     ↓
   │
   └─ Create Integration Event (for external consumers)
         - Define in: {context}/adapter/outgoing/messaging/event/
         - Name: past tense + "Event" suffix (e.g., OrderCreatedEvent)
         - Contains: only primitives and serializable types
         - Created by: Event Mapper in adapter layer
         - Published to: message broker (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
```

#### Event Publishing Rules
- Use cases call DomainEventPublisher (Output Port) to publish events
- DomainEventPublisher interface in marker/port/out
- DomainEventPublisherAdapter in adapter/outgoing/messaging
- Adapter converts domain events to integration events via mapper
- Message broker (Kafka, RabbitMQ) used for async delivery
- One topic per bounded context or per event type
- Order inside the use case: `save`, then `publishAndClearEvents` — same transaction, never before the save
- The publisher dispatches first and clears the aggregate afterwards; the clear is the acknowledgement that every listener saw the event. A throwing listener fails the use case and leaves the events on the aggregate
- Integration events go through a **transactional outbox**: the publication is written *inside* the aggregate's transaction (Spring Modulith's event publication registry, an outbox table, an in-process stand-in), released to the dispatcher after commit, discarded on rollback. Registering only after commit leaves a crash window between commit and outbox entry
- Delivery is asynchronous and at least once: failures are retried with backoff, permanently failing publications stay visible (`Failed`), outstanding ones are replayed on restart

#### Event Consumption Rules
- Event Consumer in adapter/incoming/messaging receives integration events
- Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL) protects domain from external formats
- ACL in adapter/incoming/messaging/acl converts events to domain commands
- Event Consumer calls Input Port, never domain directly
- Consuming bounded context maintains its own model
- Eventual consistency between bounded contexts via events
- Assume at-least-once delivery: consumers deduplicate (event ID or naturally idempotent operations)
- Consumers tolerate out-of-order arrival (check event version/timestamp, never assume sequence)
- Permanently failing events go to a dead-letter queue — never dropped silently
- An event handler modifies at most one aggregate, in its own transaction

#### General Domain Rules
- Domain contains business logic only
- Domain is framework-agnostic
- Domain is persistence-agnostic
- Domain is UI-agnostic
- Domain uses pure language features
- Domain can be tested without infrastructure
- Domain reflects business, not database structure
- Ubiquitous Language used throughout domain code

### APPLICATION LAYER RULES

#### Use Case / Application Service Rules
- One use case class per business operation
- Use case implements Input Port interface
- Use case orchestrates domain objects
- Use case is thin, delegates to domain
- Use case calls Output Ports for infrastructure
- Use case handles transaction boundaries
- Use case transforms DTOs to domain objects
- Use case transforms domain objects to DTOs
- No business logic in use cases
- Use case tested with port mocks
- Use case knows nothing about presentation
- Use case knows nothing about persistence details

#### Input Port Rules
- Input Port defines use case interface
- Input Port represents business operation
- One Input Port per use case
- Input Port uses domain language
- Input Port accepts Input Data/DTOs
- Input Port has no framework dependencies
- Input Port belongs to application layer

#### Output Port Rules
- Output Port defines infrastructure need
- Output Port uses domain language and types
- Output Port implemented by adapters
- Output Port has no framework dependencies
- Output Port belongs to application layer
- Repository interfaces are Output Ports
- Event Publisher interfaces are Output Ports

#### Repository Interface Rules
- Repository interface in application layer
- Repository returns Aggregate Roots only
- One repository interface per Aggregate Root
- Repository provides collection-like interface
- Repository uses domain types, not DTOs
- Repository manages object lifecycle
- Repository implementation in adapter layer
- **Repository reads return copies, never the stored instance** — see below

##### A repository hands out copies

This is where the collection metaphor stops. A `Map`-backed adapter that returns `store.get(id)`
hands out the instance it holds, so a caller who mutates an aggregate has already changed the store
and `save()` is decoration. Against a database the same code loses the change silently, because
loading a row constructs a new object — so the in-memory adapter has been hiding a missing `save()`
in exactly the tests meant to catch it.

Every adapter therefore maps back through the aggregate's `reconstitute` factory: the JDBC/JPA one
because a row leaves it no choice, the in-memory one on purpose (copy on write *and* on read).
Registered-but-unpublished domain events are not carried over — a stored aggregate is a fact, and
re-reading it must not replay what the writer already published.

Keep the adapters honest with a **contract test on the port** that every implementation runs,
including the assertion that an unsaved mutation is invisible to the next reader.

#### Transaction Rules
- One transaction per use case execution
- Transaction boundaries managed by use case
- Transaction spans single aggregate modification
- Cross-aggregate changes use eventual consistency

### ADAPTER LAYER RULES

#### Input Adapter Rules
- Input Adapter calls Input Port
- Controller extracts data from HTTP request
- Controller creates Input Data/DTO
- Controller delegates to use case
- Controller is thin, no business logic
- Controller handles framework-specific concerns
- One controller method per use case (preferred)
- A state-changing use case is reached only by an unsafe HTTP method (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) — never by `GET`; links do not create sessions, orders or carts. Prefetching, crawlers and cross-site navigation would otherwise trigger the change
- Every browser form that changes state carries a CSRF token; cookie-authenticated endpoints without one are a defect. Token-authenticated APIs (`Authorization: Bearer`) are exempt only if they neither read nor issue cookies

#### Output Adapter Rules
- Output Adapter implements Output Port
- Repository Adapter implements Repository Interface
- Adapter translates between domain and external world
- Adapter contains framework-specific code
- Adapter handles data transformation
- Adapter protects domain from external changes
- Multiple adapters can implement same port
- Adapters are replaceable

#### Presenter Rules
- Presenter implements Output Port (in some variants)
- Presenter formats use case output
- Presenter creates View Models
- Presenter knows about UI needs
- Presenter has no business logic
- Use case doesn't know about presenter implementation

#### Mapper Rules
- Mapper translates between domain and persistence
- Mapper translates between domain and DTOs
- Mapper in adapter layer, not domain
- One mapper per aggregate (typical)

#### General Adapter Rules
- Adapters depend on ports (interfaces)
- Adapters never depend on other adapters
- Adapters can be tested with integration tests
- Adapters handle technical concerns
- Domain types don't leak to external world
- External types don't leak to domain

### INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER RULES

- Framework code stays in infrastructure
- Infrastructure is a detail
- Database is a detail
- Web framework is a detail
- Infrastructure decisions can be delayed
- Infrastructure can be swapped
- No business logic in infrastructure

### STRATEGIC DESIGN RULES

#### Bounded Context Rules
- Each Bounded Context has own Ubiquitous Language
- Each Bounded Context has own model
- Same term can mean different things in different contexts
- Context boundaries are explicit
- Models not unified across contexts
- Teams own Bounded Contexts
- One Bounded Context per deployment unit (preferred)

> **Note:** For deployment variations including multi-service bounded contexts, see [Deployment Patterns](/guide/deployment-patterns.md)

#### Context Integration Rules
- Make all context relationships explicit — declare them in code on each context's `package-info.java`
  (`@Upstream`, `@ExternalUpstream`, `@Partnership`, see [Declaring Context Relationships in Code](#declaring-context-relationships-in-code))
- Use Context Map to document relationships and each context's subdomain type (Core/Supporting/Generic);
  generate it from the declarations so it cannot drift
- Protect domain with Anti-Corruption Layer
- Shared Kernel requires team coordination
- Keep Shared Kernel small
- Upstream contexts influence downstream
- Define integration patterns clearly

#### Subdomain Rules
- Focus most effort on Core Domain
- Core Domain provides competitive advantage
- Supporting Subdomains support core
- Generic Subdomains can be outsourced
- Align Bounded Contexts with Subdomains

#### Pattern Selection per Subdomain

DCA's full pattern set is not mandatory for every bounded context. Apply tactical DDD where complexity warrants it — never to trivial domains. Choose per context, by subdomain type:

| Subdomain | Business Logic Pattern | Architecture | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Core** | Rich domain model (aggregates, domain events) | Ports & Adapters, optionally CQRS / event sourcing | Full DCA rule set applies |
| **Supporting** | Transaction script or active record | Simple layering | CRUD is not an anti-pattern here |
| **Generic** | Buy / adopt (SaaS, open source) | Integrate via ACL | Don't build what you can buy |

Rules:
- Each bounded context declares its chosen pattern style in an ADR
- Architecture tests activate the matching rule subset per context: domain-model contexts get the full tactical rules; transaction-script contexts only the structural baseline (layer dependencies, no cycles, context isolation) — see [ArchUnit Governance](/guide/archunit-governance.md)
- Consistency within a context matters; uniformity across contexts does not
- Reclassify when a subdomain's importance changes (supporting → core happens) and upgrade the pattern with it — this is Progressive Complexity at the strategic level

### BOUNDARY CROSSING RULES

- Data crosses boundaries as simple DTOs
- DTOs have no business logic
- DTOs have no dependencies
- Never pass entities across boundaries
- Never pass value objects across boundaries (convert to DTOs)
- Domain events can cross boundaries (as DTOs)
- Dependencies point inward at boundaries
- Control flow can go any direction
- Use Dependency Inversion when control flow goes outward

### TESTING RULES

- Domain tested in isolation (unit tests)
- Domain tests require no infrastructure
- Domain tests require no frameworks
- Use cases tested with port mocks
- Use cases tested in isolation
- Adapters tested with integration tests
- Full system tested with acceptance tests
- Test pyramid: many unit, fewer integration, few E2E

### ERROR HANDLING RULES

#### Exception Layer Placement
- **Domain Exceptions** - Business rule violations (e.g., `InsufficientStockException`, `InvalidOrderStateException`)
- **Application Exceptions** - Use case failures (e.g., `OrderNotFoundException`, `CustomerNotActiveException`)
- **Adapter Exceptions** - Translated to appropriate responses (HTTP status codes, error DTOs)

#### Exception Flow Pattern
```
Domain Exception (invariant violation)
    ↓ propagates to
Application Layer (can catch, wrap, or let propagate)
    ↓ propagates to
Adapter Layer (translates to external format)
    ↓ returns
HTTP 400/404/422 + Error DTO
```

#### Error Handling Best Practices
- Domain exceptions should be **domain language** (not technical)
- Use cases catch domain exceptions only when they need to **transform behavior**
- Adapters (controllers) handle **all exceptions** and convert to external format
- Never expose stack traces or internal details to external consumers
- Use **exception mappers** or `@ExceptionHandler` in adapters for consistent responses

#### Example - Exception Handling Across Layers
```java
// Domain exception (business rule violation)
public class InsufficientStockException extends RuntimeException {
    private final ProductId productId;
    private final int requested;
    private final int available;
    // Constructor with domain details
}

// Application exception (use case failure)
public class ProductNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {
    private final ProductId productId;
    public ProductNotFoundException(ProductId productId) {
        super("Product not found: " + productId.value());
        this.productId = productId;
    }
}

// Adapter - Exception handler (translates to HTTP response)
@RestControllerAdvice
public class OrderExceptionHandler {
    @ExceptionHandler(ProductNotFoundException.class)
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
    public ErrorResponse handle(ProductNotFoundException ex) {
        return new ErrorResponse("PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND", ex.getMessage());
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(InsufficientStockException.class)
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY)
    public ErrorResponse handle(InsufficientStockException ex) {
        return new ErrorResponse("INSUFFICIENT_STOCK", "Not enough stock available");
    }
}
```

### TRANSACTION RULES

#### Transaction Boundary Placement
- **Transaction boundaries live at the use case level** (application layer)
- One transaction = one aggregate modification (single aggregate rule)
- Use `@Transactional` (or equivalent) on use case implementations **whose work is entirely local** — repositories, stores, event publishers
- **Never call a remote-capable port inside the transaction.** A port that may leave the process (another context's API, a payment provider, a mail gateway) called inside `@Transactional` holds the database connection for the remote round trip; under load the pool runs dry, and a rollback cannot undo the remote effect
- Use cases that need such a port **draw the boundary by hand** with `TransactionBoundary` (an application-layer execution abstraction — not a port; implemented in infrastructure): remote reads first, then `transactionBoundary.inTransaction(load, mutate, save, publish)`; remote effects after the commit, as a reaction to an integration event
- Domain layer is transaction-agnostic

#### Cross-Aggregate Consistency
- **Within same bounded context**: eventual consistency via domain events
- **Across bounded contexts**: eventual consistency via integration events
- Never modify multiple aggregates in one transaction

#### Transaction Pattern Example
```java
@Service
public class CreateOrderUseCase implements CreateOrderInputPort {

    private final OrderRepository orderRepository;
    private final DomainEventPublisher eventPublisher;

    @Transactional  // Transaction boundary at use case level
    @Override
    public CreateOrderResult execute(CreateOrderCommand command) {
        // 1. Domain logic (within transaction)
        Order order = Order.create(command.customerId(), command.items());

        // 2. Persist single aggregate
        orderRepository.save(order);

        // 3. Publish events (after persistence, before commit)
        eventPublisher.publishAndClearEvents(order);

        return CreateOrderResult.from(order);
    }
}
```

#### Eventual Consistency Example
```
Order Aggregate modified → OrderCreated event published
    ↓ (async, separate transaction)
Inventory Aggregate modified → StockReserved event published
    ↓ (async, separate transaction)
Customer Aggregate notified → Loyalty points updated
```

#### Remote Port Example — Boundary Drawn by Hand
```java
@Service                                   // no class-level @Transactional
public class AddItemToCartUseCase implements AddItemToCartInputPort {

    private final ShoppingCartRepository carts;
    private final ArticleDataPort articles;          // reaches another context — remote-capable
    private final DomainEventPublisher eventPublisher;
    private final TransactionBoundary transactionBoundary;             // application-layer abstraction (not a port) → TransactionTemplate

    @Override
    public AddItemToCartResult execute(AddItemToCartCommand command) {
        // 1. Remote-capable read — outside the transaction
        CartArticle article = articles.getArticleData(command.productId()).orElseThrow();

        // 2. Short transaction: load, mutate, save, publish
        return transactionBoundary.inTransaction(() -> {
            ShoppingCart cart = carts.findById(command.cartId()).orElseThrow();
            cart.addItem(command.productId(), command.quantity(), Price.of(article.currentPrice()));
            carts.save(cart);
            eventPublisher.publishAndClearEvents(cart);
            return AddItemToCartResult.from(cart);
        });
    }
}
```

Two rules of the DCA catalog make this a compile-time fact: `DCA-USE-012` — a use case that publishes domain events has a transaction boundary — declarative `@Transactional` **or** an explicit `TransactionBoundary.inTransaction`; `DCA-USE-013` — a `@Transactional` use case calls no output port other than `Repository`, `Store`, `DomainEventPublisher`, `IntegrationEventPublisher` (`TransactionBoundary` is not a port; a use case that needs remote reads draws the explicit boundary instead of the annotation). In .NET the boundary is a decorator around `IUseCase<,>` or `ITransactionBoundary.InTransactionAsync`; `DCA-NET-006` keeps EF Core, `System.Data` and `System.Transactions` out of the application layer.

**Note:** For complex multi-aggregate workflows, consider the **Saga pattern** (orchestration or choreography). This is an advanced topic beyond the scope of basic domain-centric architecture.

### PACKAGING RULES

- Package by feature/bounded context preferred
- Layer separation enforced by module structure
- Domain module has zero external dependencies
- Application module depends only on domain
- Adapter modules depend on application
- Infrastructure module depends on adapters
- Modules can be independently deployed
