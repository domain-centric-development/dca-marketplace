### Domain Layer (Enterprise Business Rules)

#### Tactical Building Blocks
- **Entity** - Object with identity and lifecycle
- **Value Object** - Immutable object without identity
- **Aggregate** - Transactional consistency boundary
- **Aggregate Root** - Entry point entity for aggregate access
- **Domain Service** - Stateless operation on domain objects
- **Domain Event** - Immutable record of domain occurrence (internal to bounded context)
- **Specification** - Encapsulated business rule
- **Factory** - Complex object creation logic

#### Strategic Building Blocks
- **Bounded Context** - Explicit boundary for unified model
- **Ubiquitous Language** - Shared vocabulary in code and conversation
- **Subdomain** - Logical domain partition (Core, Supporting, Generic)

### Application Layer (Use Cases / Application Business Rules)

#### Use Case Pattern with Input Ports

The application layer organizes business operations using a structured **Use Case pattern** where each use case is isolated in its own folder with dedicated Input/Output models:

**Pattern Structure:**
- **Use Case** - Implements business operation (orchestrates domain objects)
- **Input Port** - Interface defining use case contract (`extends UseCase<INPUT, OUTPUT>`)
- **Command/Query** - Input model (Command for writes, Query for reads)
- **Result** - Output model (standardized return type)
- **Output Port** - Interface for infrastructure needs (repositories, gateways, publishers)

**Organization:**
```
application/
├── {usecasename}/          # e.g., createorder, findorder, cancelorder (lowercase)
│   ├── *InputPort.java     # Interface: public interface CreateOrderInputPort extends UseCase<CreateOrderCommand, CreateOrderResult>
│   ├── *UseCase.java       # Implementation: @Service public class CreateOrderUseCase implements CreateOrderInputPort
│   ├── *Command.java       # Input model (for write operations)
│   │   OR *Query.java      # Input model (for read operations)
│   └── *Result.java      # Output model
└── shared/                 # Shared output ports
    └── *Repository.java    # Repository interfaces, DomainEventPublisher, etc.
```

> **Note:** Use case folder names are **lowercase** (e.g., `createorder`, `additemtocart`, `getproductbyid`), while the files inside use **PascalCase** (e.g., `CreateOrderInputPort.java`, `CreateOrderUseCase.java`).

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Single Responsibility** - One use case class per business operation
- ✅ **Explicit Contracts** - Clear input/output via InputPort interface
- ✅ **Self-Contained** - All related files grouped together
- ✅ **Interface Segregation** - Adapters inject only the specific ports they need
- ✅ **Better Hexagonal Alignment** - Input Ports define the application's external API

**Example:**
```java
// Input Port Interface (defines contract)
public interface CreateOrderInputPort extends UseCase<CreateOrderCommand, CreateOrderResult> {
    CreateOrderResult execute(CreateOrderCommand command);
}

// Use Case Implementation (orchestrates domain)
@Service
public class CreateOrderUseCase implements CreateOrderInputPort {

    private final OrderRepository orderRepository;  // Output Port
    private final DomainEventPublisher eventPublisher;  // Output Port

    @Override
    public CreateOrderResult execute(CreateOrderCommand command) {
        // 1. Convert DTO to domain
        Order order = Order.create(command.customerId(), command.items());

        // 2. Business logic (in domain)
        order.validate();

        // 3. Persist via output port
        orderRepository.save(order);

        // 4. Publish events via output port
        eventPublisher.publish(order.getDomainEvents());

        // 5. Convert domain to DTO
        return CreateOrderResult.from(order);
    }
}

// Input Model (Command)
public record CreateOrderCommand(CustomerId customerId, List<OrderItemDto> items) {}

// Output Model (Result)
public record CreateOrderResult(OrderId orderId, Money total, OrderStatus status) {
    public static CreateOrderResult from(Order order) {
        return new CreateOrderResult(order.getId(), order.getTotal(), order.getStatus());
    }
}
```

#### Shaping the Result

The rules above fix the *edges* of a result: its name and place (`*Result`, in the use-case package), its
immutability, and that response DTOs and view models belong to the adapter. The *middle* — what a result may
carry, who assembles it and how big it should be — follows seven sentences.

1. **A result carries values, never identities.** Allowed: primitives, nested records, value objects
   (shared kernel included — `Money`, `ProductId`), enriched domain models and read models (`Value` records
   from `domain/model` and `domain/readmodel`). Forbidden: anything assignable to `AggregateRoot` or `Entity`.
   Identity and behaviour stay behind the port; the adapter gets an answer, not a handle on the model.
   Enforced transitively — through nested records, part records and generic arguments (`List<T>`,
   `Optional<T>`, `Map<K,V>`) — by `DCA-USE-015`.
2. **Command results are small.** A command returns ids, status or outcome, and what the caller needs for its
   next step — not the view. The view comes from a query use case or a read model. Returning a whole read model
   from a command is the documented exception (it saves a remote caller a round trip), and then it returns the
   read-model `Value`, never a parade of primitives.
3. **Part records are named by content; `*Result` is the top level only.** `CartItemSummary`, `LineItemData`,
   `ProfileView` — nested in the result they belong to. A part shared by several use cases moves to
   `application/shared`; there is no feature-level `shared`.
4. **The application layer assembles the result — in order of effort.** (a) A static factory `from(...)` on the
   result, parts as records with their own `from`. (b) A projection that needs several ports is orchestration
   and lives in the use-case body. (c) When it grows or several use cases need it, a dedicated **`*Assembler`**
   in the use-case folder or `application/shared`. Never `*Mapper`, `*Converter` (`DCA-NAM-008`), never
   `Helper`.
5. **Large aggregates hand out a snapshot, not a getter parade.** A `Value` record in `domain/readmodel`, built
   by `Snapshot.from(aggregate)` (`DCA-TAC-022`). The snapshot *is* the result field; the use case does not
   flatten it a second time.
6. **The active-domain restriction is asymmetric.** An incoming adapter may read the domain values and read
   models a `Result` delivers and format them for HTTP, HTML, MCP or another transport. It must not inject or
   invoke a domain service (`DCA-HEX-012`), construct aggregates, entities or domain values, or execute domain
   behaviour: it translates external input into a `Command`/`Query` and calls an input port. Outgoing adapters
   are different: a repository or persistence adapter necessarily maps, constructs and reconstitutes domain
   objects while implementing an output port. That mapping may restore state; it must not make new business
   decisions.
7. **One model for every adapter.** Vernon's Domain Payload Object (handing whole aggregates to the UI) and the
   Mediator/double-dispatch rendering are not taken, also for in-process UIs — see
   [Deviations from the literature](#deviations-from-the-literature).

**Snapshot as the result field:**
```java
// domain/readmodel — a Value built from the aggregate, no identity of its own
public record CheckoutCartSnapshot(
        CheckoutSessionId sessionId, CheckoutStep step, CheckoutSessionStatus status,
        List<LineItemSnapshot> lineItems, Money subtotal, @Nullable CheckoutTotals totals,
        @Nullable BuyerInfo buyerInfo, @Nullable DeliveryAddress deliveryAddress)
        implements Value {
    public static CheckoutCartSnapshot from(CheckoutSession session) { /* copies state, no behaviour */ }
}

// application — the query result wraps the snapshot; nothing is flattened again
public record GetCheckoutSessionResult(boolean found, @Nullable CheckoutCartSnapshot session) {
    public static GetCheckoutSessionResult found(CheckoutCartSnapshot session) {
        return new GetCheckoutSessionResult(true, session);
    }
}
```

**Command vs. query sizing:**
```java
// Command: what the caller needs next — the next page asks the query
public record SubmitDeliveryResult(String sessionId, String currentStep, String status) {
    public static SubmitDeliveryResult from(CheckoutSession session) {
        return new SubmitDeliveryResult(
                session.id().value().toString(), session.currentStep().name(), session.status().name());
    }
}

// Query: the read model the page renders
public record GetCheckoutSessionResult(boolean found, @Nullable CheckoutCartSnapshot session) { ... }
```

What an incoming adapter may do with a delivered value or read model: call its **own, parameterless queries**
— `lineTotal()`, `priceDifference()`, `isValidForCheckout()` on an enriched cart are derivations of the
value's own state, and a read model that could not answer them would be no read model. What it must not do:
obtain or invoke a domain service, construct aggregates, entities or domain values, combine values from
several sources into a new business fact, or trigger behaviour with side effects. When a page needs a fact the
read model does not know — the tax contained in a subtotal, whether a checkout step may be opened — that fact
is computed in the use case and delivered in the result. The result is too poor when an adapter has to import
a domain service to render: a page controller that has to decide whether a checkout step may be opened asks
the query for that decision (the use case invokes the domain service and delivers a `StepAccess` value) and
maps the answer to a route.

```

Only *generic* contracts live under `marker/`: interfaces that assign an architectural role and
carry no business methods. A port with domain-specific methods — even one that several bounded
contexts share — is an **application-specific shared port** and belongs in
`sharedkernel/application/shared/`, mirroring the `application/shared/` convention each bounded
context uses for its own ports. The catalog and the bootstrap only pick up `marker/`, so this
separation keeps project concepts out of the reusable building-block set.

**Example — an application-specific shared port (Identity):**
```java
// In sharedkernel/application/shared/IdentityProvider.java — project-specific, not a marker
public interface IdentityProvider extends OutputPort {
    Identity getCurrentIdentity();

    // Nested interface - contract for identity
    interface Identity {
        UserId userId();
        IdentityType type();
        Optional<String> email();
        Set<String> roles();
        default boolean isAnonymous() { return type().isAnonymous(); }
        default boolean isRegistered() { return type().isRegistered(); }
    }

    // Nested interface - extensible identity type
    interface IdentityType {
        String name();
        boolean isAnonymous();
        boolean isRegistered();
    }
}

// In the owning context's adapter/outgoing/security/ - PROJECT-SPECIFIC implementations
public enum JwtIdentityType implements IdentityProvider.IdentityType {
    ANONYMOUS, REGISTERED, SERVICE_ACCOUNT;  // Extensible per project
}

public record JwtIdentity(...) implements IdentityProvider.Identity { ... }
```

**Why the identity port is not a building block.** Its contract returns `UserId` — a value object of
*this* project's shared kernel — and its `IdentityType` encodes *this* shop's two-cookie design (anonymous
visitor vs. registered customer). A reusable marker must carry neither, and a marker only earns its place
once a rule selects on it; every rule about identity that exists today ("the domain never reads the
caller") works over the layer packages alone. So the port is written per project, following the cut below.

**How to cut the identity port:**

1. **One output port, in the shared kernel's `application/shared/`** (or in a single context's
   `application/shared/` if only that context needs it). It extends `OutputPort`, returns an `Identity`
   made of the project's own types, and knows nothing about tokens, cookies or headers.
2. **The implementation is an outgoing adapter of the context that owns authentication** — it reads the
   security context the framework populated (`adapter/outgoing/security/`). Incoming adapters and use cases
   see only the port.
3. **The authentication filter enriches, it never gates.** It attaches an identity or nothing and lets the
   request proceed; every request has an identity (an anonymous visitor is one). Blanket
   "must be authenticated" rules at the token boundary are not where authorization lives.
4. **Ownership goes into the command.** A use case that acts on somebody's resource takes the caller as a
   field — `GetCartByIdQuery(cartId, customerId)`, `StartCheckoutCommand(cartId, customerId)` — and asks the
   repository a *scoped* question (`findByIdForCustomer(cartId, customerId)`) instead of loading by id and
   comparing afterwards. The incoming adapter resolves the caller through the port and fills the field; the
   use case never calls the identity port to find out on whose behalf it runs.
5. **A claims-only gate may stay in the adapter.** "Does this token carry the staff role?" reads nothing but
   the caller's claims and is a property of the *exposure*, so the REST resource or page controller may
   check it and refuse. Anything that needs the resource — is this cart theirs — is a property of the
   *operation* and belongs to the use case, through the command field of step 4.
6. **The domain never sees the caller.** No `User` parameter on an aggregate method, no role check in a
   value object; `cart.checkout()` protects *its* invariants (not empty, not already completed), the use
   case has already answered *who may*.
7. **A use case without a caller says so.** An event consumer completing a cart after a confirmed checkout
   acts on nobody's behalf; leave its command unscoped and document why, or the next reader "fixes" it.

Refusals are decided in the use case and *rendered* in the adapter: whether a stranger's cart answers
`403` or `404` is a protocol choice (a `403` confirms the id exists), and the REST resource makes it.

- **InputPort** - Marker interface for all entry points to the application (called by driving adapters)
- **OutputPort** - Marker interface for all dependencies the application needs (implemented by driven adapters)
- **UseCase<INPUT, OUTPUT>** - Specific input port type with Command/Query → Result pattern
- **Repository<T, ID>** - Collection-like output port for Aggregate Roots (one-per-aggregate)
- **Store** - Output port for operational data without aggregate lifecycle (Value Objects, Events, technical state)

### Repository vs. Store

DCA distinguishes two kinds of persistence-shaped output ports. Both `extend OutputPort`, but their **business semantics differ**:

**Repository** — collection-like interface for Aggregate Roots (Evans, Vernon).

- Exists **only** for Aggregate Roots
- Identity + lifecycle semantics: `findById()`, `save()`, `delete()`
- Extends the `Repository<T, ID>` marker
- One Repository per Aggregate Root

```java
public interface CustomerAccountRepository extends Repository<CustomerAccount, CustomerAccountId> {
    Optional<CustomerAccount> findById(CustomerAccountId id);
    void save(CustomerAccount account);
}
```

**Store** — records or queries operational data without an own aggregate lifecycle.

- Exists for **Value Objects, Events, or technical state** without identity-based access
- Append-/record-style semantics: `record()`, `count()`, `exists()`, `reset()` — no `findById()` / `save()`
- Extends the `Store` marker (`Store extends OutputPort`) — never the `Repository` marker
- Implementation lives in `adapter.outgoing/`

```java
public interface LoginProtectionStore extends Store {
    void record(LoginAttempt attempt);
    int  countRecentFailures(BaseStore baseStore, Email email, Duration window);
    boolean isLoginBlocked(BaseStore baseStore, Email email);
}
```

**Decision matrix:**

| Criterion | Repository | Store |
|---|---|---|
| Stored object | Aggregate Root | Value Object / operational data |
| Identity & lifecycle | yes — `findById`, `save`, `delete` | no — `record`, `count`, `exists` |
| Marker | `extends Repository<T, ID>` | `extends Store` |
| Examples | `CustomerAccountRepository`, `OrderRepository` | `LoginProtectionStore`, `AuditLogStore`, `EventStore` |

**Rules of thumb:**

1. Need `findById()`? → Repository (the object has identity).
2. Need `record()` or `count()`? → Store (the object is recorded, not managed).
3. In doubt: if the stored object is a `Value` or a record, it's almost always a Store.

> **Note on EventStore (Event Sourcing):** The `EventStore` from Event Sourcing is a *specialization* of Store — one specifically for Domain Events that supports aggregate reconstruction. The general `Store` is the broader pattern for any operational data.

> **Note on cross-cutting `*Response` classes:** Generic Response/error classes (`ErrorResponse`, base `Response`, `SimpleResponse`) belong in the **shared kernel's adapter-incoming package**, not in any individual bounded context. ArchUnit rules that check `*Response` placement must include the shared kernel adapter — discover its package dynamically via `@SharedKernel` rather than hardcoding the name (`shared` / `common` / `core` / `sharedkernel`).

**Why the distinction matters:**
The naming is part of the Ubiquitous Language. A reader should know from the interface name alone whether they're dealing with a managed aggregate (Repository) or recorded data (Store) — without opening the implementation. Both are technically Output Ports in hexagonal architecture, but the business role is fundamentally different.

**What Belongs in Shared Kernel:**

✅ **Include:**
- **Universal value objects** used by multiple contexts (Money, Price, shared IDs)
- **DDD marker interfaces** that define your architectural patterns (Entity, AggregateRoot, Value, etc.)
- **Base port interfaces** (`UseCase<INPUT, OUTPUT>`, `Repository`, `DomainEventPublisher`)
- **Specification pattern implementations** (CompositeSpecification, And/Or/Not specifications)
- **Cross-cutting domain concepts** that have identical meaning everywhere

❌ **Exclude:**
- **Aggregates** - These belong to specific bounded contexts
- **Business logic** - Should live in context-specific domain layers
- **Context-specific value objects** - Only truly universal ones belong here
- **Use case implementations** - Belong to specific contexts
- **Adapters** - Never shared between contexts

**Guidelines:**
- Keep the Shared Kernel **as small as possible**
- Changes to Shared Kernel affect all contexts - coordinate carefully
- Only include code that has **identical meaning** across all contexts
- When in doubt, duplicate rather than share
- Use versioning if Shared Kernel becomes a separate module

**Decision Tree: Should This Go in Shared Kernel?**
```
START: I have code that might be shared
   │
   ├─ Is it used by 2+ bounded contexts?
   │     NO → Keep in single context
   │     YES ↓
   │
   ├─ Does it have IDENTICAL meaning everywhere?
   │     NO → Duplicate instead (different models OK)
   │     YES ↓
   │
   ├─ Is it a marker interface or base type?
   │     YES → Add to sharedkernel/marker/tactical/
   │     NO ↓
   │
   ├─ Is it a universal value object (Money, Address)?
   │     YES → Add to sharedkernel/domain/model/
   │     NO ↓
   │
   └─ Is it a base port interface (UseCase, Repository)?
         YES → Add to sharedkernel/marker/port/
         NO → Probably shouldn't be in Shared Kernel
```

**Example - Marker Interface:**
```java
// sharedkernel/marker/tactical/Id.java
public interface Id {
    // Marker interface - typed identifiers, no type parameter of their own
}

// sharedkernel/marker/tactical/Entity.java
public interface Entity<T extends Entity<T, ID>, ID extends Id> {
    ID id();
    default boolean sameIdentityAs(T other) {
        return other != null && id().equals(other.id());
    }
}

// sharedkernel/marker/tactical/AggregateRoot.java
public interface AggregateRoot<T extends AggregateRoot<T, ID>, ID extends Id>
        extends Entity<T, ID> {
    // Marker interface - identifies aggregate roots for all contexts
}
```

**Example - Shared Value Object:**
```java
// sharedkernel/domain/model/Money.java
public record Money(BigDecimal amount, Currency currency) implements Value {

    public Money {
        Objects.requireNonNull(amount);
        Objects.requireNonNull(currency);
        if (amount.scale() > 2) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Money cannot have more than 2 decimal places");
        }
    }

    public Money add(Money other) {
        if (!this.currency.equals(other.currency)) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cannot add money with different currencies");
        }
        return new Money(this.amount.add(other.amount), this.currency);
    }
}
```

**Example - Port Interface Hierarchy:**
```java
// sharedkernel/marker/port/in/InputPort.java
public interface InputPort {
    // Marker interface for all input ports (hexagonal architecture concept)
}

// sharedkernel/marker/port/out/OutputPort.java
public interface OutputPort {
    // Marker interface for all output ports (hexagonal architecture concept)
}

// sharedkernel/marker/port/in/UseCase.java
public interface UseCase<INPUT, OUTPUT> extends InputPort {
    OUTPUT execute(INPUT input);
}

// sharedkernel/marker/port/out/Repository.java
public interface Repository<T extends AggregateRoot<T, ID>, ID extends Id> extends OutputPort {
    Optional<T> findById(ID id);
    T save(T aggregate);
    void deleteById(ID id);
}

// Usage in a bounded context:
// order/application/createorder/CreateOrderInputPort.java
public interface CreateOrderInputPort extends UseCase<CreateOrderCommand, CreateOrderResult> {
    // Inherits execute() method with specific types
