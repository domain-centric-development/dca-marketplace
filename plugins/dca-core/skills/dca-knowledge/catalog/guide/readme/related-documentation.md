This document describes the core Domain-Centric Architecture patterns and principles. For specific topics, see:

> **📝 Note on Examples:** This documentation uses **generic examples** (Order, Customer, Inventory contexts) for educational clarity. The actual reference implementation uses **Product Catalog**, **Shopping Cart**, and **Portal** contexts. Both approaches are valid - use examples that match your domain. Package names shown as `com.company.project.*` are placeholders; a real project uses its own root (the reference implementations use `dev.domaincentric.sample.ecommerce` in Java and `DcaShop` in .NET). The guide is written in Java; [Language Mappings](/guide/language-mappings.md) translates every concept to C#/.NET.
