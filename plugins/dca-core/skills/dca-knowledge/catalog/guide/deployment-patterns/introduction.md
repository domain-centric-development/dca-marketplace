While the main [Domain-Centric Architecture](/guide/readme.md) defines the logical structure of bounded contexts and layers, this document addresses **deployment strategies** and **physical boundaries**.

- **Logical Boundary** = Bounded Context (DDD concept)
- **Physical Boundary** = Service/Deployment Unit (infrastructure concept)

**Core Question:** When should one Bounded Context be deployed as multiple services?
