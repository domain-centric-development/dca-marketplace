The `onion` rule set (`DCA-ONI-*`) is named after this pattern. DCA keeps its central claim — all
coupling points inward, the domain model at the centre — and does not encode the ring layout itself;
`DCA-ONI-001/002/003` check the dependency direction and the domain's freedom from framework
metadata. Palermo's first ring is also the published support for putting repository *interfaces*
inside the application boundary rather than in infrastructure, which DCA otherwise presents only as
a deviation from Evans and Vernon.

  - Four-part series; coupling toward the centre, domain model innermost, infrastructure outermost
  - ArchUnit's own `onionArchitecture()` implements these rings — deliberately not used here, see
