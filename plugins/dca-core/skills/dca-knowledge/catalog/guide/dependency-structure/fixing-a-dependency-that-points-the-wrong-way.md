When an adapter needs something that sits in infrastructure, one of three moves resolves it:

1. **Declare it as an output port.** The interface goes into the application layer, the
   implementation into `adapter/outgoing`.

   ```java
   // {context}/application/shared/MetricsPublisher.java
   public interface MetricsPublisher extends OutputPort {
       void increment(String metric);
   }

   // {context}/adapter/outgoing/metrics/PrometheusMetricsAdapter.java
   class PrometheusMetricsAdapter implements MetricsPublisher { /* … */ }
   ```

2. **Move it into the shared kernel** when it is framework-agnostic and every context needs it.

3. **Move the concern into the use case.** Often the adapter should not have had it at all — the
   application layer is where the decision belongs.
