The pipeline above says nothing about deployment, and it does not have to. The publication is
written *inside* the aggregate's transaction either way, and delivery is asynchronous and at least
once either way. Only the leg in the middle differs.

**One deployable — in-process.** The registry is the outbox. A listener in the consuming context
picks the contract up after the commit; a retry worker replays what did not finish.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph P["PRODUCING CONTEXT"]
        AGG["Order aggregate"] --> TX[["transaction:<br>state + publication"]]
        TX --> OUT[("Publication registry<br><i>the outbox</i>")]
    end
    OUT -- after commit --> LIS["Event listener<br><i>consuming context</i>"]
    subgraph C["CONSUMING CONTEXT"]
        LIS --> ACL["Anti-corruption layer"] --> IP["Input port"]
    end
    RETRY["Retry worker<br><i>bounded attempts, backoff</i>"] -. replays unfinished .-> OUT
```

**Several deployables — over the wire.** The same registry, the same after-commit wakeup. What
changes is that an externalising adapter hands the contract to a broker, and the consumer runs an
incoming event adapter instead of a listener.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph P["PRODUCING SYSTEM"]
        AGG["Order aggregate"] --> TX[["transaction:<br>state + publication"]]
        TX --> OUT[("Publication registry<br><i>the outbox</i>")]
        OUT -- after commit --> EXT["Externalising adapter<br><i>adapter/outgoing/event</i>"]
    end
    EXT -- publishes --> BROKER{{"Message broker<br><i>Kafka, RabbitMQ, …</i>"}}
    subgraph C["CONSUMING SYSTEM"]
        CONS["Event consumer<br><i>adapter/incoming/event</i>"] --> ACL["Anti-corruption layer"] --> IP["Input port"]
    end
    BROKER --> CONS
```

The contract is the same object in both pictures, and so is everything the domain and application
layers see. Moving from the left picture to the right one replaces one adapter and adds an
operational concern — it does not touch a use case, an aggregate or a contract. That is what makes
the modulith a starting point rather than a compromise.

The right-hand picture also buys a failure mode the left one does not have: the broker can accept a
message the producer never learns was accepted. Provider-side idempotency deduplicates the repeat;
without it, a duplicated external effect stays possible.
