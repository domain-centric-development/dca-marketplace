An epic's `metric` is a **domain or integration event whose publication in production is the
evidence that the epic delivered**. Not a story count, not a burndown, not "feature shipped".

The reason is that a story can be complete and an epic still worthless. Every criterion may be met,
every test green, the documentation current — and nobody uses the thing, so the problem in the
epic's `intent` is untouched. A story count measures the team's motion; an outcome event measures
the change in the system's behaviour that the epic existed for.

Because DCA applications already publish domain events for the facts that matter, the metric is
usually a name that exists:

```text
metric: OrderPlaced          # the epic's point was that orders can be placed at all
metric: CartRecovered        # the epic's point was that abandoned carts come back
metric: StockChanged         # the epic's point was that an operator reacts before stock runs out
```

Where the event does not exist yet, that is a finding rather than a problem: the event is part of
the work, and naming it in the epic is what makes the epic measurable. Where an application keeps an
event publication log — a record of the events it published, which the event-driven patterns in this
guide produce anyway — that log is the measuring point, and no separate analytics apparatus is
needed to answer whether an epic delivered.

Two failure modes to avoid. An event named after the *implementation* ("row inserted", "endpoint
called") measures that code ran, not that anything happened for anyone. And an event that fires on
the way in ("checkout started") measures intent, not outcome; the outcome is the fact at the end of
the flow.

### Validation: the outcome can happen

Naming the event is half of it. The other half is that the code publishes an event of that name — and
nothing compares the two unless something is made to. A stage that translates the story's verb on its
own (*add* where the epic says *create*) produces an application in which every criterion is met and the
epic's measure never fires, because the event it counts is called something else.

So the story after which the outcome can happen — the step that completes the flow — says so:

```yaml
publishes: OrderPlaced
```

Two gates then hold it, one on each side:

| Gate | Checks |
|---|---|
| plan | the name is a word of the epic's `metric` — two names for one outcome are found before a line of code |
| document | the production code declares a type of that name, and a file the story changed — the aggregate that raises it, the use case that publishes it — refers to it |

The reviewers and the judge read the epic too, so a synonym that slips past a gate is still a finding.
A journey (below) then guards the way to the event once the epic's stories are delivered.

What the pipeline checks is that the outcome **can** happen: locally, in CI, without users. Whether it
**does** — the event counted against a target after the deploy — is operations, and needs a running
system with real users. The outcome event is the hook that measurement attaches to; the pipeline
does not pretend to be it.
