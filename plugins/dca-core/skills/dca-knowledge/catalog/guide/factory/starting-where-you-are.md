**From zero, in a fixed order.** A project that starts empty gets its description first — what is to
be built, the technical decisions, the designed cut — and its skeleton second, from the stack's own
generator, so the versions are the generator's and not anyone's memory. Then the repository, the
architecture's building blocks and rule suite, a formatter run once over everything, and a browser
runner wherever the product has pages — each before the first story, because a story that has to set
one of them up in passing takes a stack decision nobody asked for. The proof is that the application
starts, every suite is green, and the browser smoke test goes red when the start page's title is
emptied.

**Empty means green.** In a project with no backlog, no glossary and no context map, nothing above
fails on absence: each stage says which file to create, and the gate reports what it skipped and
why. The first story is written, and the process works from there.

**Brownfield stays brownfield.** The contract applies to *new* items. An existing backlog is not
migrated wholesale and existing tests are not renamed: rewriting finished work would invent intents,
goals and outcome events nobody ever stated, and every one of those epics would then fail the gate
for good reason. The gate only ever looks at the story it is called with.
