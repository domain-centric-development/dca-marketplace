Before the first story, two files describe what is to be built and a third, optional one describes
the designed cut. They are written with the person who decides, one question per heading, and nothing
in them is invented: a stage that reads an invented look builds it.

**The product** — `product.md`:

| Heading | Says |
|---|---|
| What and for whom | the product in two or three sentences, and its actors |
| Surfaces | pages, notifications, an API, a tool — and on which devices |
| How it works | the main flow across epics; where state lives and what is persisted |
| Look and feel | style direction, language, accessibility level, the styling approach |
| Qualities | security and authorisation stance, privacy, performance, availability |
| Not part of the product | what it deliberately will not do |

**The technical decisions** — `tech.md`:

| Heading | Says |
|---|---|
| Stack | language, framework and build tool |
| Frontend approach | server-rendered pages, a client application or none — and what that excludes |
| Persistence | where state is kept and how, and what the product does not use |
| Runtime | where and how it runs |
| Integrations | the external systems it talks to |
| Version policy | how dependencies are chosen and kept current |

**The designed domain** — `domain.md`:

| Part | Says |
|---|---|
| Bounded contexts | each context, its responsibility and its subdomain type (core, supporting, generic) |
| Relationships | upstream and downstream, the pattern, where the translation happens, and the reason |

They hold decisions, never code design. "The client keeps the draft; the server stores what is
submitted" belongs in the product; "server-rendered pages, no client framework" in the technical
decisions; an endpoint or a package in neither.

Two failures make the description the first artefact rather than an optional one. A decision nobody
took lands in the first story that needs it. There it surfaces as a plan that stops for a human, at
the moment nobody is there to answer. And what no artefact states does not get built: a build stage
that makes the smallest change that works builds a page without a stylesheet, correctly, when no
look was stated. So the backlog skill writes no story while the product or the technical description
is missing, and it checks each new story against all three before the story is released: a context
not on the designed map, an actor or a surface the product does not have, a need the technical
decisions exclude — each is a question asked while the person is there. The stages plan and build
within the description, and a change that contradicts it is a review finding.

The project instructions name the three files and bind every implementation to them — a stage of the
factory, and a person developing by hand in a session alike: read them first, and treat a
contradiction as a finding, not as something to fix in the code. A session has what a stage has.
