The judge returns exactly one of three verdicts, and the third is the reason this list exists:

- **pass** — the criteria are met and no confirmed defect blocks them.
- **changes-requested** — confirmed defects go back to the build stage with their evidence. Count
  the rounds and stop at three: a loop that will not converge needs a human, not a fourth attempt.
- **story-conflict** — the story or the plan is wrong. This never goes back to the build stage. A
  correction that changes an agreed criterion must not happen silently; the story is the contract,
  and a human decides it.

Two more questions belong to a human by construction, and a run that meets one of them stops and
says so instead of answering it:

- **A new bounded context, or a new relationship between contexts.** That is a decision about
  language boundaries and ownership, recorded as a decision and reflected on the context map — never
  smuggled in by a story.
- **A surface the story's actor does not have.** If the criteria can only be observed through a page
  or an endpoint the context does not offer, adding one is a product decision, and where the surface
  needs a guard it is an authorisation decision as well. A guard nobody decided is a guard no test
  holds.
