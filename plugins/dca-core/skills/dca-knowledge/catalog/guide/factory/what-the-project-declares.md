Nothing above knows how your project builds. That knowledge lives in one file the project owns —
build and test commands, one entry per test source set, the architecture suite, the formatter — plus
the backlog, the glossary and the context map it keeps anyway. A stage asks the project; it never
assumes a build tool, a test framework or a directory layout. The file can be prefilled by
detection — one small description per build tool, browser runner or formatter the setup recognises —
and a person corrects it where detection is wrong; detection is never consulted during a run, so the
file stays the one contract. The formatter appears twice: as the check the gate runs, and as the
command that corrects the formatting, which the stages that write code run before they finish.

The same file says whether the project drives a browser: the runner's name (`browser: playwright`) when
its end-user command runs a browser suite, `none` when it deliberately has none. A criterion only a browser can observe then
gets a browser test; with `none` the plan takes the next lower level and says what that cannot show.
Unset, such a criterion stops the plan once for the stack decision rather than degrading every story.

The same file may name the model each tool runs a stage on, as a key bound to the tool
(`model.<tool>.<stage>`). It is bound to the tool because a model's name means nothing to another
tool: an unbound key in a shared profile breaks a colleague's run with a different tool at the first
stage it names. The process itself names no model; which stages can run on a cheaper one without
the review finding more is the project's to measure. A stage run in its own process sees only the
project — its skills, its settings, the craft the profile names — and not the plugins or servers of
whoever starts it, so two people get the same pipeline.

Two consequences. Adding a capability (a formatter, a second test source set, another review
perspective) is a line in that file, not an edit to a stage. And a stage that would break in a
project without your domain in it is wrong: the process is general, the project's knowledge is the
project's.
