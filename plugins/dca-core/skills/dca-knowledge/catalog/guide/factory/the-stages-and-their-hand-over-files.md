One story runs through six stages. Every stage is a **closed assignment**: it reads the story and
its predecessor's file, and it writes exactly one file of its own. No stage relies on a
conversation, so a stage can run in a fresh context, in a separate process, or on another day
without changing the result.

| Stage | Reads | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| plan | the story, the glossary and context map if present | `tasks/<story>/plan.md` |
| test | the story, `plan.md` | `tasks/<story>/tests.md` — with the criterion-to-test table |
| build | the story, `plan.md`, `tests.md` | `tasks/<story>/build.md` |
| tidy | the story, `plan.md`, `build.md`, the green code | `tasks/<story>/tidy.md` |
| judge | the story, all predecessors, the diff | `tasks/<story>/judge.md` — with a verdict |
| document | the story, all predecessors, the project's documents | `tasks/<story>/document.md` |

The **plan** names the elements that change — aggregates, value objects, use cases with their ports,
adapters — in the project's own vocabulary, and picks the shape of the end-user test per criterion
from what the project can run *today*. It backs every statement about the code with a file and a
line. It writes no code.

The **test** stage writes one end-user test per acceptance criterion, plus unit tests for the
invariants the story introduces, and records the mapping:

```markdown
| criterion | test |
| --- | --- |
| shows-empty-state | com.example.reporting.MonthlyReportPageTest#showsEmptyState |
```

It adds only the stubs the test sources need to compile, and a stub **refuses to answer** — it
throws rather than returning a value, even an empty one. A stub that returns the answer a criterion
expects makes the test green before any code exists, and a green test at this point proves nothing.

The **build** stage makes those tests pass with the smallest change that works, following the plan's
change list. An element the plan did not name is a sign the plan was wrong: it is noted, not quietly
added. It never changes a test to make it pass.

The **tidy** stage is the refactor half of red–green–refactor, which the build stage deliberately
leaves undone. It works only inside the story's footprint, changes no test and changes no behaviour.
A tidy stage that changes nothing and says why is finished, not skipped.

The **judge** stage reviews the change from three perspectives that always run — the model, the
boundaries, the craft — with a file and a line behind every finding, and returns one of three
verdicts (below). A project may add further perspectives; it cannot switch the three off, because a
review without the boundaries is not a review of a domain-centric architecture.

The **document** stage brings the glossary, the context map and the project's reader documentation
in line with what the story changed, and it carries the same duty of proof as the code: every path,
file, class and command it names must exist, checked rather than remembered, and written as it
resolves from the project root.
