A factory that delivers stories has three parts, and each lives in its own place:

- a **project description** — what is to be built, written by people before the code;
- a **backlog** of epics and stories, written by people, each story small enough for one run;
- a **runner** that works the backlog off, stage by stage, with a check between the stages.

```text
project/                   what is to be built (people write it)
  product.md               what, for whom, surfaces, qualities, what it is not
  tech.md                  stack, frontend approach, persistence, runtime, integrations, version policy
  domain.md                the designed cut: contexts, subdomain types, relationships and why
  backlog/
.agents/factory/           how it is worked off (the machine: profile, checks, runner)
tasks/<story>/             the stages' hand-overs
docs/                      what exists and why — written after the code, some of it generated
```

`project/` holds **intent**: written before the code, and read by every stage as input. `docs/` holds
**what exists and why** — architecture documentation, decision records, maps generated from the
code, user and operations guides — written after the code, by people and by the stage that documents
a story, which writes only what the code confirms. The rule of thumb: an intention that need not be
built yet goes to `project/`; a statement the code could show goes to `docs/`. Glossaries stay beside
the code of their context. Where the two places meet — the designed map against a map generated from
the code — a difference is a finding, not a duplicate: a context planned and not built yet, or built
without having been designed.

Setting the factory up is one step that does only what is missing, in any order relative to the
code: the description before the code, the code before the description, or an existing project that
has both and gets the factory added. A second run finds everything in place and writes nothing.
