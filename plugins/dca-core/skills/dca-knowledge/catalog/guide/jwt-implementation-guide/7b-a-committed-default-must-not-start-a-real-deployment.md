Everything above is configuration, and configuration ships with a value that makes the application
start on a laptop: a signing secret in the repository, an operator account with a password anyone
can read, cookies without `Secure` because the developer's URL is `http`. Each is deliberate and
each is fine — until the same values start somewhere else, which they do silently. Nothing fails, no
log line says anything, and the application behaves exactly as it does in development. A committed
secret is a published secret: whoever can read the repository can mint a token the deployment
accepts.

Documenting them as dev-only does not hold. A comment is read by the person who already knows;
the deployment is done by someone who does not.

Fail at startup rather than on first use. A configuration refused while the deployment is watched is
a rollback; the same refusal on a visitor's first request is an incident.

The check belongs where the options are bound, one per group of settings, so a context owns the
rule about its own configuration rather than a central class knowing everybody's secrets. What must
not differ is the answer to "is this a development run" — two components disagreeing on that is one
of them accepting a shipped value where the other refuses it.
