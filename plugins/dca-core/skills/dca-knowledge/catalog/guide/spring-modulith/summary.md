**Spring Modulith implements [Domain-Centric Architecture](/guide/readme.md) by:**

1. **Enforcing Boundaries** - Modules = Bounded Contexts with verified boundaries
2. **Event-Driven** - Domain Events and Integration Events with guaranteed delivery
3. **Clear Structure** - `api/`, `events/`, `internal/` packages
4. **Progressive Complexity** - Start simple, grow as needed
5. **Testing** - Verify structure and test modules in isolation

**Migration Path:**
- Start with Spring Modulith modular monolith
- Extract to microservices when needed
- Event-based integration survives extraction
