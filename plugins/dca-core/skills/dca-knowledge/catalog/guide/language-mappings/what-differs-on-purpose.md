- **Async ports, synchronous domain.** Every .NET port method is `Task`-based and takes a
  `CancellationToken`; aggregates, values and domain services never are. The Java ports are synchronous.
- **Physical modules.** A .NET context is a project; a Java context is a package. Both are verified
  the same way, but only the .NET compiler refuses a cross-context reference to an `internal` type.
- **No `package-info`.** The context marker class is the one file a Java reader will not recognise.
- **No baseline dial** in .NET governance; lower a rule to a warning instead.
- **Transactions are explicit** in .NET (`ITransactionBoundary`, or a decorator around `IUseCase`);
  Java may use `@Transactional`. `DCA-USE-012` demands the boundary in both languages for every use case
  that saves or deletes an aggregate or publishes domain events — in Java it also guards Spring's
  after-commit relay, which is skipped silently without an active transaction; in .NET the evidence is
  the `InTransactionAsync` call or the configured transactional attribute on every entry path.
- **Container attributes** (`@Upstreams`, `@Partnerships`) do not exist in C# — attributes repeat.

Everything not listed here is the same architecture, spelled the way the language spells it.
